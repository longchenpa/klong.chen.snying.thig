<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Tsa</h2>
</center>
<br>


<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is written in blue pencil numbers.
At the front of the volume, there is a small rectangle of the same
colour orange cloth as that used for wrapping the text (see below) but
more closely woven, on which is stuck a rectangular IOL paper sticker,
which is white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped
decoration in each corner).  We find red handwriting, reading, '328
pages', blue writing, reading, 'MISC. COLL. GYUT 17', and in large Tibetan
writing, 'rgyud tsa'.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Some sheets
are thicker than others; most are quite thick, appearing to consist
of two layers of paper, which is clear in cases where the layers
are beginning to come apart. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets is 577 x 125mm.  There is some size variation (eg. 227 is
570 x 125mm). </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes,
many of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways,
some of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do
occur, they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-3.  gNyis and gsum each have a triple yig mgo, and
the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  The regular double
yig mgo usually start on or to the right of the red vertical margin
delineators, and are rarely large in comparison with some of the
other volumes.  There are some slight differences in style, with some
larger or more elongated than others. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume seems to be of a fairly consistent style throughout, similar
to that of Volume Pha, and varying slightly in size, although some
sheets have writing with ink strokes rather thicker than others,
and sheets near the end of the volume tend to have smaller writing
than earlier ones. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The writing
in this volume is rarely obscured by tears and rips. Most sheets
are in a reasonable state with few holes or tears - there are occasional
small holes and tears. Some sheets have small edge indentations
at the bottom of sheets, eg. 2-4, 64, 79, 88, 89, 118, 188, 231,
237, 318.   There is a small hole and tear at the bottom of 13 but
it does not affect the writing. There is a small indentation and
tear at the top of 29a. There are some indentations and tears at
the sides, especially on the right - eg. 47, 51, 58, 62, 77, 80,
81, 96, 110, 111, 114, 158, 160, 177-181, 187-193, 196-200, 209,
230-1, 237-8, 262-6, 270-1, 280, 282-5, 302, 322-3.  Folio 214 has
a few tears and indentations around the sides and top. 246 has an
indentation on the left-hand side, so too 323-327. 279-287, and
322-328 have small indentations at the top. 66 has a small hole
on the right-hand side; so too has 72, 73, and 154. 166 has small
holes in the middle of the page but the writing remains legible.
63 has the right bottom corner torn off, and tears to the side and
bottom; 92 the top right corner torn off; 184 has the bottom left
corner torn off, 203 the top left corner torn off. 64 and 88 have creases
along the left top corner; 223 and 293 are creased along the bottom
right corner. 75 has a hole in the writing area, but the words remain
legible. 90 has a tear at the top; 169 has a tear at the bottom.
Many sheets are a little discoloured or dirty, with some ink smudging,
and some blotches. The last few sheets have a number of black blotches
at the top right. The final sheets 327 and 328 are particularly
discoloured in this respect. Some sheets have pieces of paper stuck to
them as repairs - eg. 13b (bottom) has a small piece of paper stuck
to it, apparently as a repair; so too do 163a, 187a, 226a, 269a,
281b, 284a, 285a, 319a, also at the bottom.  242b has a paper repair
at the top left; 252a, 279a, and 281a, at the right side, 308b at
the top. 18a has two small pieces of paper stuck to the bottom of
the page, apparently as repairs (so too 319b), and 18b has a further
piece near the bottom of the folio which rather obscures some of
the last line of writing. 20a has a small piece stuck to the bottom
of the side. 64 has three small pieces of paper stuck to the bottom
of the page and 134 has 4 (and tears to the left-hand side). 113
has a piece overlapping the top of the recto and the bottom of the
verso side. 289 has two pieces overlapping the recto and verso sides,
as well as a large corner torn from the bottom right. 327 has three overlapping
pieces, one quite long, and a piece stuck to the recto side, covering
a whole in the right upper writing area, slightly covering some
syllables, which are, nonetheless, still legible. Another hole in
the same position in 328 is covered with a piece of paper stuck
to the verso side. On 328a, the repair is in the right red margin
area. A long piece of paper also covers the left verso side of the
folio, reinforcing the left-hand side of 328a. </font>

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The blue lacquered
front folio is plain blue in colour on the recto side, with margins
ruled in red, making a box, 460 x 45mm.  No index leaves are attached
to the right hand side of the folio, although a single red stitch
and a stitch hole indicate where the index leaves once must have
been attached.  </font>
</p>

<h2>Index Leaves</h2>

<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are no index leaves in this volume.</font>
</p>
<hr>
 

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 12 sheets, 572 x 125 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. The box made by the ruled
lines measures 429 x 70mm to the right, 72mm to the left. The blue
sheet is torn at the edges and the blue lacquer is rubbed off in
parts. Thick crossed stitches attach the folio together, two along
the top, five along the bottom, and one to the left and the right
of the folio.   Some straight red stitches are visible in a horizontal
line along the bottom of the side, attaching the covering to the
top of the verso side. </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper
sheet has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  450 x 72mm,
outlined (around the frame) with a red paint line. There is a tear
in one section of the upper window frame, and a small blank piece
of paper is stuck on, apparently repairing another tear in the top of
the sheet; horizontal straight red stitches attaching the covering,
are visible to the right of the upper window frame.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a material cover fitted over the window, with three layers sewn
together. The yellow layer is at the top, with gold thread around
the outside, and it measures 431 x 60mm visible (the upper part
tucks under the blue frame above).  A blue layer is the middle layer,
with white thread around the outside, measuring  445 x 65mm visible
to the right, 70mm to the left.  The third and final layer beneath
is orange, with green thread around the outside, measuring 456 x
71mm visible to the right, 74mm to the left. They are not exact
rectangles of material, the orange bulges out a little at both sides
near the bottom, its bottom edge forms a slightly wavy line, and
it does not quite cover the whole of the window frame, especially
on the right, where there is a gap between the curtain and frame. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, the wave design (see "General Information
on Volumes"). The larger miniature in the centre, which breaks up the
page, is bounded to the left and right by a thin double vertical
gold line, outlining a rectangle,  84 x 67mm. The lefthand miniature
is within a rectangle 52 x 68mm, the righthand miniature's rectangle
is 50 x 67mm. The central miniature is a little less clear than
the others, especially the central face is rather faded, dirty with
marks on it. The legends for the miniatures are written below each,
within the border of gold lines outside the window. Each legend
is within double ornamenal brackets: </font>

<p>
<b>Cloth volume wrapping</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The whole text
is wrapped in a coarse rectangular piece of orange cloth with a
fringe along one side, and a number of holes in it.  </font>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, within
a double gold rectangular box, the outer measuring 475mm at the
top, 477mm at the bottom x 76mm on the left, 80mm on the right.
 The margins are ruled as usual, with the collection, volume and
folio identification to the left. The folio is a laminate of about
5 layers, with thick cross stitches visible on both sides, two to
the top and bottom, one to the left and right.  The verso side is
ordinary paper. </font>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 6a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins.  2b and 3a
each have 4 lines of black writing; 3b - 5b, have 5 lines of slightly
smaller writing, and 6a, 6 lines of writing.  The boxes are not
very exact rectangles, and the ink sometimes is of variable thickness.
Some of the lines overshoot the boxes, and this is especially noticable
on 4a.  The boxes measure as follows. 2b: 502top/504 bottom x 85mm;
3a: 492 x 85mm; 3b: 490 x 80mm; 4a: 487 x 80right/82mm left; 4b:

left; 6a: 489 x 82 to right and 85mm to left.  6b starts the usual
style of red margins down each side and 7 lines per side.</font>
