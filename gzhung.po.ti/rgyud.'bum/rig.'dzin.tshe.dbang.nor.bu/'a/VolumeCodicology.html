<h2>Codicological information on Volume  'A</h2>
</center>
<br>


<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is written in blue pencil numbers.
 The second index leaf (see below) bears a rectangular IOL paper
sticker, white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped
decoration in each corner), with the red handwriting: "326 pages";
and in blue writing, "Misc. COLLN. GYUT 23."; and in large Tibetan
writing, "rgyud 'a". </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Some sheets
are thinner than others (eg. 111), although most are quite thick,
appearing to consist of two layers of paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets is 578 x 125mm.  There is some size variation (eg. 31 and
101 are 569 mm in length, (the first) 177 only 542 mm), and some
sheets are not cut very straight (especially, many of the left-hand
edges go down to the left; 280 has an unevenly cut bottom edge). </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes,
many of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways,
some of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do
occur, they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.   The lines are ruled with
faint (diluted?) reddish ink. The writing is not always exactly
square on the page (eg. on 53, it goes slightly down from left to
right).  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-3.  gNyis and gsum each have a triple yig mgo, and
the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  The regular double
yig mgo usually start on or to the right of the red vertical margin
delineators.  There are some slight differences in style, with some
larger or more elongated than others. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume seems to be quite consistent in style, with some size variation;
the letters are mostly clear and distinct.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Corrections and interventions</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> We
have an instance (236b) of an insertion marked in the same way as
that on 144b of volume Ya: a symbol of a cross with a small circle
in each of the four corners made by the cross; the symbol marks
the place in the text and is repeated above the writing area, in
front of the insertion which is given in small writing.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Readers' marks
		</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">9a has the added words
in what appears to be pencil, "rgyud dgu", written in poor large
writing, to the left of the page, under the folio identification
in ink. There appear to be some faintly drawn doodles, possibly
in the same hand, to the bottom of 101a, to the left and bottom
of 165a, and to the left of 167 and 168.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Very occasionally,
an ink smudge makes the writing difficult to read (eg. 151a). </font>
</p>
</p>
   

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The writing
in this volume is rarely obscured by tears and holes, although many
sheets are damaged, especially at the edges, and particularly in
the first part of the volume. The first folios, particularly those
up to 13, are in poor condition, with damage to the upper parts
of each sheet, possibly through water damage, but despite some transference
of parts of the upper layers of sheets to adjacent folios and the consequent
removal of parts of the red boxes and some black ink, as well as
tears out of the sheets (eg. 3), the writing is mostly legible (occasionally,
part of a line is missing, eg. 8a line 1; 11b line 7). The condition
of the sheets improves later in the volume, but there are still occasional
sheets (eg. 61) which appear to have been affected by water damage
and have a section of the top layer of paper removed or displaced,
and the final sheets in the volume are also in fairly poor condition,
especially the last few folios where there are significant holes
in the writing area. There are many sheets with edge indentations,
in the first third of the volume especially at the top, where the
sheets have been damaged, but also some indentations along the bottom
and sides of sheets, and such indentations continue throughout the
volume. Some sheets have one or more small holes outside the writing
area (eg. 86, 88, 90-98, 162, 175, 189, 191-3, 195, 248, 250-67,
274, 278, 304-6, 312-19, 322, 326), and some have holes within the
writing area (eg. 18, 109, 116-7, 185-6, 250, 322-6) which mostly
do not obscure the writing (eg. the hole on 18 appears to predate
the writing since space has been left for it). Some sheets have
tears from the edges (eg. 11, 18, 22-24, 38, 44-5, 56, 88, 200,
238), or tears out of the edges (eg. 244); some folios are rather
crinkled, and many sheets are brownish in colour and in some cases
rather dirty. However, the clear writing is hardly ever obscured.
There are some attempted repairs. 23 has a large tear, which has
been partially repaired with a strip of an IOL label stuck along
one side on the part of the tear outside the writing area. Other
sheets have small pieces of Tibetan paper stuck at the edge over
one (eg. 146a, 189b, 190a, 193b, 225a, 249b, 251a, 252b) or over both
sides (eg. 27, 159, 250, 255) of a tear or hole. There is an impressive
repair of 46, which appears to have been torn into two, and carefully
stuck together, with the aid of paper on each side of the folio,
at the top and bottom. A tear from the top of 56 also seems to have
been repaired by sticking the two parts of the sheet together, although
without any added paper. There is a rather less successful repair
of 93, which like 46, appears to have been torn in two. In this case,
the two edges of the tear have not been lined up exactly correctly,
but the repair has successfully bound the two sides, with thread
stitching visible above and below the writing area on 93a, and two
pieces of paper stuck on the other side of the stitching on 93b.
323 also has a repair where the sheet appears to have been torn
in half: the tear has been left in the centre of the folio, allowing
the writing to be read, while paper sticks the two sides together
above and below the writing area. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The damaged and repaired
blue lacquered front folio measures approximately 560 x 113mm. The
folio appears to have been torn right down the sheet in two places
and partly down the sheet in another place: the tears have been
repaired by paper stuck along them. Two of the repairs attempt to
preserve the original shape of the sheet, and in one case, the red
box has been carefully left, with the paper stopping above and below
it. However, in one case, the paper repair appears not to be of
Tibetan paper and the 'repair' attaches the incorrect sides of the
folio together. The sheet otherwise is in poor condition, with tears
in the edges, creasing, and bits of red material stuck on it. The
lacquer has come away over much of the folio, and some parts are
green.  Margins are ruled in red, in what was once the recto side (now
split over the two sides), making a box measuring 337mm on one side,
plus 100mm visible on the other side x 45 mm. Both the recto and
verso sides are plain blue, and the index leaves are sewn to the
right of the verso side of the folio, with two thick leather cross
stitches, backed up with white thread stitches which attach the
layers together. </font>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 17 sheets, 570 x 124 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. The top sheet is in poor
condition: much of the lacquer has been rubbed off, there appears
to have been some water damage and the gold lines are visible but
not very clear. There are also some tears into the sheet from the
edges. The box made by the ruled lines measures 406 x 64mm (left)/ 67mm
(right), with the vertical lines not at exact right angles to the
horizontal lines, but coming down slightly to the left.  Thick crossed
stitches attach the folio together, two along the top, five along
the bottom, and one to the left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper
sheet has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  448 x 72mm,
outlined (around the frame) with a red paint line. There is a tear
in the centre of the upper window frame.  The lower window frame
is untorn but in poor condition, with parts of the lacquer and gold
lines entirely rubbed away. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window, with three layers sewn together,
the material rather stained and the colour faded.  The upper part
of the cover tucks under the window frame above. Due to the tear in
the centre of the upper window frame, yellow running stitches are
visible beneath the frame, attaching the material layers to the
sheets below.  The yellow layer is at the top, with gold thread around
the outside, and it measures  426mm (above)/ 421mm (below) x 89mm
to the top of the folio, 62 mm visible beneath the frame.  A blue
layer is the middle layer, with white thread around the outside,
measuring  436mm (above)/ 428mm (below) x 66 mm visible beneath
the frame to the left and 68 mm visible to the right.  The third
and final layer beneath is orange, with green thread around the
outside, measuring 446 (above)/ 440 (below) x 74 mm visible beneath the
frame to the left and 72mm visible to the right. They are not exact
rectangles of material, they go in slightly to the bottom and the
bottom edge of the orange layer forms a slightly wavy line, and
it does not quite cover the whole of the window frame, especially
on the right and left sides, where there are slight gaps between
the curtain and frame. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, the wavy line and spiral design (see
"General Information on Volumes"). The miniatures on this folio
are finely executed, and the central miniature has an elaborately
painted background. The larger miniature in the centre, which breaks
up the page, is bounded to the left and right by a thin double vertical gold
line, outlining a rectangle, 80 x 70mm. The lefthand vertical lines
come down very slightly to the left. The lefthand miniature is within
a rectangle 51 x 69mm, the righthand miniature's rectangle is 50
x 69mm. The legends for the miniatures are written below each, within
the border of gold lines outside the window. Each legend is within
double ornamenal brackets. They are partly illegible, having been
partly rubbed out, but where they are unclear, they can be reconstructed
easily following the parallels with other volumes: </font>

<p>
<b>Cloth volume wrapping</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The whole text
is wrapped in a coarse square piece of red cloth with string attached
to two of the corners to tie around the text in wrapping it. </font>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The second folio, gnyis,
measures  575 x 125 mm. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, within
a double gold rectangular box, the outer measuring  481 x 76 mm,
the inner, 465 x 65 mm.  The margins are ruled as usual, with the
collection, volume and folio identification to the left. The boxes are
not exact rectangles; the vertical lines are not at exact right
angles to the horizontal lines, coming down slightly to the left.
The folio is a laminate of about 9 layers, with thick cross stitches
visible on both sides, two to the top and bottom, one to the left
and right.  The condition of the lacquered sheet is poor: much of
the lacquer and some of the gold has been rubbed out, possibly through
water damage, but the writing remains legible. The verso side is
ordinary paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 6a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins; in the case
of 2b and 3a, with an inner double red lined rectangular box.  2b
and 3a each have 4 lines of black writing; 3b - 5b, have 5 lines
of slightly smaller writing, and 6a, 6 lines of writing.  The boxes
are not very exact rectangles, and the ink sometimes is of variable
thickness. Sometimes, the lines overshoot the boxes or do not quite
join up at the corners.  The writing lines are not exactly parallel
to the horizontal lines of the boxes: the lines 4a-6a come up slightly
at the right. The boxes measure as follows. 2b (outer): 493 x 78mm
(left)/ 80mm (right); 3a (outer): 495 x 82mm (left)/ 84mm (right);
3b: 483 x 77mm (left)/ 80mm (right); 4a: 491 x 83mm (left)/ 78mm
(right); 4b: 494 (above)/ 491 (below) x 84mm (left)/ 80mm (right);
5a: 488 x 78mm (left)/ 80mm (right); 5b: 480 x 80mm; 6a: 485 x 80mm
(left)/ 85mm (right).  6b starts the usual style of red margins
down each side and 7 lines per side.</font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Elements of decoration</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   4a and
4b have decorated strips in the left and right-hand margins, exactly
the same as 2b in Volume Pha, black ink designs, in this case, with
the wave pattern (see "General Information on Volumes"). The pattern
is not properly completed in the left margin of 4a, where the lower
quarter of the strip changes from carefully drawn curved lines in
definite directions to curved squiggles drawn haphazardly.</font>
