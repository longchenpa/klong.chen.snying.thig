<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Pa</h2>
</center>
<br>


<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is in black ink stamped numbers.
At the front of the volume, there is a long rectangle of flower
patterned Western cloth, on which is stuck a rectangular IOL paper sticker,
which is white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped
decoration in each corner).  We find red handwriting, reading, '296
pages', blue writing, reading, 'MISC. COLLN. GYUT 13', and in large
Tibetan writing, 'rgyud pa'.   </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Some sheets
are thinner than others (eg. 93, 104), although most are quite thick,
appearing to consist of two layers of paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets is 575 x 125mm.  There is some size variation, and some sheets
are not cut very straight (eg the left edge of 67 comes out to the
left at the bottom). </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes,
many of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways,
some of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do
occur, they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.   The lines are ruled with
faint (diluted?) reddish ink. The writing is not always exactly
square on the page (eg. it goes down slightly to the right on 63a
and 153a).   </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-3.  gNyis and gsum each have a triple yig mgo, and
the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  The regular double
yig mgo sometimes start on or to the right of the red vertical margin
delineators, sometimes to the left.  There are some slight differences
in style, with some larger or more elongated than others. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume seems to be quite consistent in style; the letters are mostly
clear and distinct.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are occasional
ink smudges (eg. 5a, 21a, 119a, 231a).  There is a red ink mark
at the beginning of a mantra on 15, but this may not be deliberate;
the mantra is one of a series which begins earlier. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The writing
in this volume is rarely obscured by tears and rips. Most sheets
are in a reasonable state with few holes or tears - there are occasional
small holes and tears, or ink smudges, and most sheets are brownish
in colour and in some cases rather dirty. However, the clear writing
is hardly ever obscured . We find small edge indentations on many
folios, especially on the right hand edges, and there are small edge
tears on 3, 8-9, 16, 19, 47, 73, 138, 235, 266. Some sheets (eg
69, 74, 103, 146, 197, 220, 294-6) have small holes outside, and
some (eg. 21, 173, 219, 248) holes within the writing area, and
some (eg 106, 144, 194, 207) are missing part of a corner of the
paper. 136 has a long tear within the writing area; some of the
writing has been partially torn off but the words remain legible.
 212 has part of the top layer of paper torn away at the top, although
the writing is unaffected; other sheets (eg. 17, 279) have smaller
tears from the top layer of paper. Very occasionally, part of a
syllable, or slightly more writing has been transferred to an adjacent
sheet (eg. 17b/18a), presumably due to water damage. We find small
thin pieces of red paper with jagged edges stuck, perhaps accidentally,
on 19b, 46b, 47a, 166b, 167a, 192b, in some cases slightly obscuring
the writing. The right hand edge of 21b has what appears to be small
bits of mud stuck to it, as though it has been dropped in dirty
ground and not cleaned off. 36a has a large splotch as though splashed
by a dirty liquid, but the writing remains clear; 148a is marked by
a smaller similar splotch. A small amount of a brown coloured substance
is smeared across a few syllables on 92a. The only folio which has
deliberate repairs and reinforcements is the final folio 296. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The blue lacquered
front folio, measuring approximately 562 x 115mm (left)/ 111mm (right),
is torn at the edges, especially at the left and right edges. The
lacquer has come away in parts. It is plain blue in colour, with
margins ruled in red, making a box 446 x 44mm left/ 38mm right.
At the front of the volume, there is a long rectangle of flower
patterned Western cloth, on which is stuck a rectangular IOL paper
sticker with volume identification (see above). </font>

<h2>Index Leaves</h2>

<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are no index leaves in this volume.</font>
</p>
<hr>
 

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 15 sheets, 571 x 123 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. The box made by the ruled
lines measures 425 x 70 mm, with the vertical lines not at exact
right angles to the horizontal lines, but coming down slightly to
the left. The blue sheet is torn slightly at the edges and there
are a few small holes in the top layers of the sheets.  The blue
lacquer is rubbed off in parts. Thick crossed stitches attach the
folio together, two along the top, five along the bottom, and one
to the left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper
sheet has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  500 x 72mm,
outlined (around the frame) with a red paint line.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window, with three layers sewn together;
the upper part tucks under window frame above, but the frame is
torn with a small section missing so that the top of the yellow
layer is visible, along with yellow running stiches attaching the
cover to the folio. The yellow layer is at the top, with gold thread
around the outside, and it measures 425 x 81 mm to the top of the folio,
61mm visible below the frame to the left, 59 mm to the right.  A
blue layer is the middle layer, with white thread around the outside,
measuring  437 (above)/ 432 (below) x 68mm (left)/ 63mm (right)
visible below the frame.  The third and final layer beneath is orange,
with green thread around the outside, measuring 450 (above)/ 445
(below) x 75mm (left)/ 71mm (right) visible below the frame. They
are not exact rectangles of material, the orange left edge goes
in towards the bottom, its bottom edge forms a slightly wavy line,
and it does not quite cover the whole of the window frame. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, the diamond and swastika design (see
"General Information on Volumes"). There is some black smudging
at the bottom of both of the strips, extending slightly into the
areas where the left and right miniatures are painted. The larger
miniature in the centre, which breaks up the page, is bounded to
the left and right by a thin double vertical gold line, outlining
a rectangle, 80 x 71mm. The lefthand miniature is within a rectangle
51 x 70mm, the righthand miniature's rectangle is 49 x 69mm. The
legends for the miniatures are written below each, within the border
of gold lines outside the window. Each legend is within double ornamenal
brackets: </font>

<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The second folio, gnyis,
measures  575 x 125 mm. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, within
a double gold rectangular box, the outer measuring 485 x 80 mm,
the inner, 468 x 68 mm.  The margins are ruled as usual, with the
collection, volume and folio identification to the left.. The boxes
are not exact rectangles; the vertical lines are not at exact right
angles to the horizontal lines, coming down slightly to the left.
The folio is a laminate of about 8 layers, with thick cross stitches
visible on both sides, two to the top and bottom, one to the left
and right. Some of the inner sheets are ruled with 7 lines and red
margins.  The verso side is ordinary paper. </font>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 6a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins; in the case
of 2b and 3a, with an inner double red lined rectangular box.  2b
and 3a each have 4 lines of black writing; 3b - 5b, have 5 lines
of slightly smaller writing, and 6a, 6 lines of writing.  The boxes
are not very exact rectangles, and the ink sometimes is of variable
thickness. Sometimes, the lines overshoot the boxes or do not quite
join up at the corners.  The boxes measure as follows. 2b (outer):
498 x 80 mm; 3a (outer): 492 x 80 mm; 3b: 490 x 80 mm; 4a: 476 x
79 mm; 4b: 479 x 76 mm; 5a: 490 x 80 mm; 5b: 485 x 76mm (left)/
72mm (right); 6a: 495 x 80mm (left)/ 84mm (right).  6b starts the
usual style of red margins down each side and 7 lines per side.</font>

<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b>

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> There is no folio 7. However, it seems that this is a misnumbering
rather than a missing folio; folio 8 appears to follow on from folio
6.  We have compared our text with that in the gTing skyes edition
of the same text and established that no text is missing.  Folio
6 appears to have been re-numbered; an original syllable (number?)
seems to have been rubbed from the folio in front of "drug". </font>
