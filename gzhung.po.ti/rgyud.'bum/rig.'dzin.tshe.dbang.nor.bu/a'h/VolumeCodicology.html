<h2>Codicological information on Volume  A'h.</h2>
</center>
<br>


<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is written in blue pencil numbers.
  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Some sheets
are thicker than others, and many of them are made up of at least
two layers. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets is 577 x 125mm.  There is some size variation and some sheets
are not cut very straight (eg. 63 is 560mm top/572mm bottom x 122mm
left/120mm mm right, both sides coming out to the bottom; 64 is
573mm top/560mm bottom x 122mm, both sides coming in to the bottom.
There are many similar sheets. The top of 249 is cut in a zig-zag
fashion for the whole length. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes,
many of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways,
some of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do
occur, they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.   The lines are ruled with
faint (diluted?) reddish ink. On many folios in this volume, the
double red vertical lines bordering each side of the writing area
are partially erased. In some cases (eg. 49), the writing is not
exactly square on the page, the horizontal ruled lines going down
slightly to the right.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Except
for 74-76, up to and including 170, the truncated Om. syllable with
a gter shad (
<font color="green"> gter yig mgo a thung (U0F01</font>)
  
, + ma, 
<font color="green"> anusva&rsquo;ra (U0F7E</font>)
  
, above) are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-4.  gNyis, gsum and bzhi each have a triple yig mgo,
and the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  There are some
slight differences in style in the regular Om. syllables, with some
larger or a slightly different shape from others.  In the case of
the recto sides of 74-76, and of all from 171 (ie. all parts of
the volume which have the usual style of shads and which presumably
are not gter ma), we find the usual double yig mgo (except for 187a,
which is a title page, and 187b, which follows it and which has
a triple yig mgo). </font>
</p>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Note that gter tsheg 
<font color="green">  (U0F14</font>)
  
 begin at folio 3a and are used up until the bottom of 65a, from
where we find rnam bcad 
<font color="green">  (U0F7F</font>)
  
 instead of gter tsheg.  Ordinary shad are used between 74-76, after
which rnam bcad are again used, from 77.   Finally, from 170b, we
find ordinary shad rather than rnam bcad. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The writing in this
volume varies a little in style and size. The writing tends to be
quite large near the beginning of the volume, but becomes considerably
smaller around 79, increasing in size again, around 177, and becoming
especially large in the following twenty or so folios.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Corrections and interventions</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is some evidence of later corrections. For instance, there are 7
syllables added at the bottom of the sheet on 67b, attached via
dots to the 3rd line, seemingly in a different hand from that of
the scribe. Similarly, we find an additional insertion (perhaps
in the same hand) above the writing area on 70a.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Some of the ink
is smudged at the top of 198b, making some of the central syllables
in the upper two lines more difficult to read. </font>
</p>
</p>
   

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Many, in fact
most, of the folios in this volume are badly creased or frayed at
the edges, especially at the top and at the left of the folio, and
many have corners torn off or creased up. The condition of the folios
gets worse from 132, when we start to find black spots and considerable
folding, creasing, and edges torn away at the top left corners of
the folios. Despite this and the discolouration/blotching/dirtiness
of most of the sheets, the writing in this volume is usually clear
(although eg. 158a is washed out at the top, affecting a few syllables).
From 169-170, we also find creasing at the top right. The black
spots and creasing at the top of folios ceases from 172. However,
we have more black spots and creasing to the upper right-hand edges
from 203. The condition of the sheets improves again from 230.</font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are also occasional small holes and tears. Sheets with
small edge indentations include: 4-6, 12, 18, 21, 22, 29, 72-5,
84-8, 98, 122, 126, 147, 160, 181, 196, 204, 215, 226/227, 236,
245, 262, 263. Sheets with small holes within the writing area,
which may partially obscure the writing, include: 50, 53, 15, 222,
245. Sheets with small holes outside the writing area include: 5,
12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21 - 23, 25, 27-29, 31, 38-41, 71, 76, 83-4,
99-101, 199, 203, 228, 260. Sheets with repairs of small pieces
of paper stuck along part of an edge include 6, 19, 26, 126, 137,
258. Sheets with small edge tears include: 19, 27, 41, 45, 49, 51,
72, 88, 239. Sheets with a single corner torn off include: 28, 33,
57, 98, 100, 265, although a lot more sheets have corners creased
up or otherwise damaged. 34 is badly creased up in the centre of
the folio; 141b has a large tear at the bottom of the top layer
of paper although the layer beneath is unaffected and the writing
is still legible, and 248b has a similar tear outside the writing
area affecting only the top sheet. The last two folios, 266 and
267, are torn around the edges, and 267 has lost two of its corners.
However, the writing is still clear. </font>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 18 sheets, 570 x 125 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. The box made by the ruled
lines measures 420 x 67 mm, with the vertical lines not at exact
right angles to the horizontal lines, but coming down slightly to
the left. The blue sheet is torn at the edges and creased down the
centre of the folio.  Thick crossed stitches attach the folio together,
two along the top, five along the bottom, and one to the left and
the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>  <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper
sheet has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  445 x 75mm,
outlined (around the frame) with a red paint line. One section of
the upper window frame is torn off, but none of the outer pattern
is torn away.  The lower window frame is missing its central section, from
the first to the second lower stitch holding the folio together. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window, with three layers sewn together.
 Horizontal yellow stitching sewing the window covers onto the sheets
beneath is visible in the gap where the upper frame is torn.  The yellow
layer is at the top, with gold thread around the outside, and it
measures 432 x 66mm visible beneath the blue frame (the upper part
tucks under the frame above, and a further 22mm is visible in the
gap where the upper frame is torn).  A blue layer is the middle
layer, with white thread around the outside, measuring 435 x 67mm
visible.  The third and final layer beneath is orange, with green
thread around the outside, measuring 445 x 71mm visible to the left,
73mm to the right. They are not exact rectangles of material, the
orange layer comes out very slightly at both sides near the bottom,
and is slightly shorter on the left, not quite covering the bottom of
the window. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, wavy line and spiral design (see "General
Information on Volumes"). The larger miniature in the centre, which breaks
up the page, is bounded to the left and right by a thin double vertical
gold line, outlining a rectangle, 82 x 70mm. The lefthand miniature
is within a rectangle 51 x 70mm, the righthand miniature's rectangle
is 50 x 70mm.  The legends for the left- and right-hand miniatures
are written below each, within the border of gold lines outside
the window. There is no legend for the central miniature (it would
have been on the lost central part of the lower window frame), and
the legend for the right-hand miniature is so smudged out, it is
unreadable. The left-hand legend (and apparently the right-) is
within double ornamenal brackets: </font>

measures  572 x 125 mm. </font>

</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, slightly
smudged in the area to the right and centre of the page but still
legible, within a double gold rectangular box, the outer measuring
480 x 77mm left/75mm right.  The margins are ruled as usual, with
the collection, volume and folio identification to the left. The
box is not an exact rectangle, but almost a parallelogram, with
the vertical lines coming down slightly to the left. The folio is
a laminate of about 10 layers, with thick cross stitches visible
on both sides, two to the top and bottom, one to the left and right.
The blue lacquered recto side is rather torn at the top and bottom
edges. The verso side is ordinary paper. </font>

<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 5a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins; in the case
of 2b and 3a, with an inner double red lined rectangular box.  2b
and 3a each have 4 lines of black writing; 3b - 4b, have 5 lines
of slightly smaller writing, and 5a, 6 lines of writing.  The box
on 5a is drawn over another box with faded lines which was not drawn
very straight on the page; thus, some of the margin lines of this
box go over the letters written to the left and to the top right
of the main box.  The boxes measure as follows. 2b: 488 x 81mm;
3a: 490 x 85mm left/82mm right; 3b: 490 x 80mm; 4a: 487 x 81mm;
4b: 482 top/490 bottom x 81 mm; 5a: 476 x 82mm.  5b starts the usual
style of red margins down the side and 7 lines per side. </font>
