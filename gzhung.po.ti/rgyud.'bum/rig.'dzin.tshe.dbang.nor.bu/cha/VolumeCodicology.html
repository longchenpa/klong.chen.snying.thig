<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Cha</h2>
</center>
<br>
 

<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is in black ink stamped numbers.
 The first index leaf (see below) bears a rectangular IOL paper
sticker, white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped
decoration in each corner), with the red handwriting: "308 pages";
and in blue writing, "MISC. COL GYUT 6"; and in large Tibetan writing,
"rgyud cha". </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Most sheets
are quite thick but some sheets are comparatively thin, eg. 305.
 </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The size of the plain
sheets is 578 x 125mm. There is some size variation, and some sheets
are not cut very straight (eg. the upper edge of 42 and 270 are
uneven, the left edge of 178, 233, 307 and others). </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes, many
of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways, some
of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do occur,
they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.  The lines are ruled
with faint (diluted?) reddish ink.  The writing is not always exactly square
on the page (eg. the final line of 16a goes up and down across the
page; the writing on 102b goes up slightly to the right.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-3.  gNyis and gsum each have a triple yig mgo, and
the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  Furthermore,
184b has a triple yig mgo, following a title page, 184a, and 295b
also has a double yig mgo, following a title page, 295a. The regular
double yig mgo usually start on or to the right of the red vertical
margin delineators.  There are some slight differences in style,
with some larger or more elongated than others.  One distinctive
feature of this volume is that we find much less use of yig mgo
to introduce new texts than in other volumes. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume seems to be of a fairly consistent style throughout, with
the letters mostly clear and distinct and the ink often quite thick.
 The writing varies only very slightly in size. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>      
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are
some ink smudges, eg. 37b has a smudge in the top centre of the
page; 144b, 146a and 302 have brown ink splotches, but the writing
remains legible. 149a and 166a also respectively have some brown and
black blotching.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The writing
in this volume is rarely obscured by tears and rips. Most sheets
are in a reasonable state with few holes or tears. There are a few
folios with small holes outside the writing area: eg. 12-13, 17,
73, 77-79, 143-4, 149, 188-9, 195, 219-222, 251, 253, 255. In the
case of 14-16, 57, 69, 82, 121, 124, 128, 209, 213-5, 219, 225,
259, 263, there are holes within the writing area, or 196, a tear
within the writing area, but the writing is still mostly clearly
legible. The holes in 209 and 259 appear to have predated the writing,
since spaces are allowed for them. Some folios have edge tears, eg.
14, 23, 49, 66, 107, 130, 139, 149, 168, 193, 215, 226, 262, 273;
or corner tears, eg. 88, 112, 137, 148, 259, 283; some have edge
indentations, eg. 22, 24-5, 39, 87, 105-116, 124-5, 127, 135, 138,
141-3, 147-8, 161, 168, 173, 186, 203-7, 216, 225, 233, 240, 241,
249, 285-291, 305. 273 has a crease in the paper at the bottom right
corner. The final folio, 308, has edge pieces missing in several
places but the writing area is unaffected.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The blue lacquered
front folio, measuring approximately 535 x 110 mm, has tears in
the edges and some edge parts are torn away completely. The lacquer
has come away in parts. It is plain blue in colour, with margins ruled
in red on the recto side, making a box 455mm x 35mm (left)/ 40mm
(right).  The index leaves are  sewn to the right-hand side of the
folio, with large twisted red and yellow thread stitches visible
both sides. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The first
folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 17 sheets, 570 x 124 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. The box made by the ruled
lines measures 416 x 69mm (left)/ 72mm (right), with the vertical
lines not at exact right angles to the horizontal lines, but coming
down slightly to the left. The blue sheet is torn slightly at the
edges and there are a few holes in the top layers of the sheets.
 The blue lacquer is rubbed off in parts. Thick crossed stitches
attach the folio together, two along the top, five along the bottom,
and one to the left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper sheet
has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  450 x 74mm, outlined
(around the frame) with a red paint line.  There are some tears
in the blue lacquer area outside the window, including two tears
through the upper window frame, and small sections of the blue lacquer
are missing to the bottom right. However, none of the frame is entirely
cut away; nor is any of the writing affected. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window, with three layers sewn together.
The yellow layer is at the top, with gold thread around the outside,
and it measures 422 x 62mm visible (the upper part tucks under the
blue frame above).  A blue layer is the middle layer, with white
thread around the outside, measuring  434 x 66 mm visible.  The
third and final layer beneath is orange, with green thread around
the outside, measuring 445 x 75 mm visible. They are not exact rectangles
of material, the lower edge of the orange layer forms a slightly
wavy line.  To the left it bulges out and goes in at the bottom,
and it does not quite cover the entire window frame.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, the wavy line and spiral design (see
"General Information on Volumes"). The larger miniature in the centre,
which breaks up the page, is bounded to the left and right by a
thin double vertical gold line, outlining a rectangle, 83 x 70mm.
The lefthand miniature is within a rectangle 51 x 68mm, the righthand
miniature's rectangle is 50 x 70mm. The legends for the miniatures
are written below each, within the border of gold lines outside
the window. Each legend is within double ornamenal brackets: </font>

<font color="red">[<font color="red">first, to the left:</font>]</font> {{<font color="red">[yig

<br>
<br>
<Volnote> 

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The second folio, gnyis, measures
577 x 126 mm. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, within
a double gold rectangular box, the outer measuring 480 x 80 mm,
the inner, 463 x 68 mm.  The margins are ruled as usual, with the
collection, volume and folio identification to the left.. The boxes
are not exact rectangles; the vertical lines are not at exact right
angles to the horizontal lines, coming down slightly to the left.
The folio is a laminate of about 10 pages, with thick cross stitches
visible on both sides, two to the top and bottom, one to the left
and right. Some of the inner sheets are ruled with 7 lines and red
margins.  The verso side is ordinary paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 6a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins; in the case
of 2b and 3a, with an inner double red lined rectangular box.  2b
and 3a each have 4 lines of black writing; 3b - 5b, have 5 lines
of slightly smaller writing, and 6a, 6 lines of writing.  The boxes
are not very exact rectangles, and the ink sometimes makes thicker lines,
for instance on 4a, where parts of the box have two clear thin red
lines but at the bottom right, the thick ink lines almost merge
together. The boxes measure as follows. 2b: 493 (top)/ 491 (bottom)
x 83 mm; 3a: 500 x 82 mm; 3b: 495 (top)/ 492 (bottom) x 84mm (left)/
79mm (right); 4a: 490 x 81mm (left)/ 84mm (right); 4b: 487 x 75mm
(left)/ 80mm (right); 5a: 486 x 82 mm; 5b: 490 x 86mm (left) 81mm
(right); 6a: 491 x 84mm (left)/ 80mm (right).  6b starts the usual
style of red margins down each side and 7 lines per side.</font>
