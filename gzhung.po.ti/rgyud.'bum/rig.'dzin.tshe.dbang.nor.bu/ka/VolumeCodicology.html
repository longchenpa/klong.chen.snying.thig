<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Ka</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>  

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">In this volume, there is western numbering in small pencil
numerals in the top right corner of each recto side. Given that
these numbers are in a different position from the western numbers
in all other extant volumes, it seems likely that the numbering
in the other volumes has been added by the India Office Library,
while the numbering here has been added by the Bodleian Library.
 On the recto side of the front blue lacquered folio, there is a
small white ticket attached to the upper right, with blue typed
writing sideways on the page: SC 34697.</font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Some sheets are
thinner than others (eg. 145-6), although most are quite thick,
appearing to consist of at least two layers of paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The size of the plain
sheets is 573-7 x 123-5 mm. Very occasional sheets are not cut very
straight (eg. left edge of 37-8), and thus, do not form exact rectangles.</font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes,
many of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways,
some of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do
occur, they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>
    

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.  The lines are ruled with
faint (diluted?) reddish ink. </font>
</p> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing is not
always exactly square on the page (eg. on 46a and 75a, the writing goes
down slightly on the page from left to right; on 56b, the writing
goes up slightly on the page from left to right).</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-4.  gNyis, gsum and bzhi each have a triple yig mgo,
and the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  The regular
double yig mgo usually start on or to the right of the red vertical
margin delineators.  There are some slight differences in style,
with some larger or more elongated than others. One distinctive feature
of the writing in this volume is that the dotted shad 
<font color="green"> (tsheg shad) (U0F0F</font>)
  
 consistently used to mark the first or last   syllable  of  a 
line,  is  written  rather  large,  with  a  flourish.         
       </font>
</p>
</p>
       

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are some variations
in the size of the writing.  For instance, the writing on some pages
(eg. 14a-6, 17a) is small; there are 7 lines, but they do not come
down so far on the page as usual. As the volume continues, the ink
gets rather thicker than it is on the early pages. On some folios
(eg. 196, 216), the ink has absorbed into the sheet to such an extent
that it can be seen on the opposite side of the sheet.</font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Corrections and interventions</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Occasionally,
attention is drawn to the positioning of an insertion given outside
the writing area, by red shading over the area in the text, eg.
97b, 221b, 269b. In one case, 234a, as well as such red shading,
we find the symbol of a clockwise pointing swastika marking the
place in the text, and the insertion.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Readers' marks
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">On 198b line 2, we
find the beginning of a text marked by a cross of two small pieces
of white paper stuck to the sheet just in front of the title.</font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are
occasional  ink smudges (eg. 56a, 89a, 140a, 212a, 248a), and some
sheets are brownish in colour or have brown blotches (eg. 33a, 48b,
70b-71b, 101a-102b, 239a). However, in comparison with other volumes,
this volume is relatively unmarred by blemishes other than holes.
 The clear writing is hardly ever obscured.</font>
</p>
</p>
          

<p>
<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b> 
                                                               
                                                               
                                                               
                                                               
                                                               
                                                               
                               
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">174 (brgya don bzhi) seems
to have had an original numbering after the "brgya" deleted from
the page and replaced with "don bzhi" to the right.    </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets
in this volume are reasonably firm and intact, with few tears, although
there are small holes and indentations around the outside of virtually
all the folios. Many folios have a very large number of such holes,
having very jagged or uneven edges as a result, and few folios are
entirely unmarred by holes or indentations. Many sheets also have
at least one small hole within the writing area, and many of these
have several, although there are not so many holes over the writing
as there are around the edges. In general, the sheets near the beginning
and the end of the volume tend to be the worst affected. This volume
has far more holes and indentations than other volumes, and such holes
even affect the front folios with the miniatures. Despite this peppering
of so many of the sheets with holes, there is no evidence of other
damage, such as water damage causing folios to stick together, or
for top layers of the paper to come away. In general, since the
holes are mostly small, the letters mostly remain legible.</font>
</p>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
are also occasional small edge tears (eg. 33, 264, 293-4), or creasing
down the folio (eg. 87, 92, 125).</font>
</p> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There is an instance
of what appears to be an attempted repair to a tear: on 158, a small piece
of paper is stuck over the edge on both sides, partially obscuring
the bottom of a syllable on line 7 of 158a. We also find paper repairs
to the final folio 294. Since these repairs are similar to repairs
found in other volumes, we can conclude that it is likely they were
made before the volumes of the collection were separated.</font>
</p>
</p>
   

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The azure blue lacquered
front folio measures approximately 550mm (at its widest, but much
of the left hand edge has torn away) x 117mm (left)/ 110mm (right).
It also has further tears in the other edges. The lacquer has come
away in parts, and there are many small holes across the folio.
The recto side is plain blue, but with margins ruled in red, making
a box measuring 440mm x 46mm (left)/42mm (right).  The verso side
is plain blue.  The index leaves are attached to the right hand
side of the verso side of the folio, sewn on with 2 large leather
red cross stitches.</font>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 6 sheets, measuring 567
x 122 mm. </font>
</p> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer,
but with gold margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio
identifications given at the left border, in quite large gold writing. The
box made by the ruled lines measures 440 x 65 mm, with the vertical
lines not at exact right angles to the horizontal lines, but coming
down slightly to the left. The blue sheet is torn slightly at the
edges, the blue lacquer is rubbed off in parts, and there are numerous
small holes in the top layer, but since the layer beneath is also
blue lacquer, only blue shows through. Thick crossed stitches attach
the folio together, two along the top, five along the bottom (although
the left-hand stitch does not come through to the upper sheet) and
one to the left but not the right of the folio. The sheets appear
to simply be stuck along the right hand side. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>  <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is mid-blue, with elaborate intertwining straight gold
lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the same
interlocking key design as we find in other volumes, but in this
case, instead of a simple pattern of gold on the azure blue page,
we find that the strips of the key design are in black lacquer,
outlined in gold, and the background is mid-blue, slightly shiny
but unlacquered. The upper sheet has a rectangular window cut out
for the text, 442 x 70mm, outlined (around the frame) with a red
paint line. </font>
</p>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Also, uniquely in this first volume, beneath
the legend for the central miniature, within a gold outlined black
lacquer box fitting into a rectangle of blue made by the pattern
of intertwining gold lines, in two lines of tiny gold writing we
find a name (possibly identifying the artist or head of the team
of artists), which reads, "snya bsod nams <font color="red">[sa subscribed,
end line]</font> chos 'phel/".</font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window. Unlike the other volumes
which have three layers, this volume, as the first, has five, although
only the upper and bottom layers are complete rectangles. The other layers
seem to consist of outer borders, about 20mm wide. All five layers
are stitched together.  The yellow layer is at the top, with a wide
band of blue stitching outlining the bottom three sides of an inner
rectangle at the upper part of the layer. There is gold thread around
the outside of this top layer, measuring 410 x 50 mm visible (the
upper part tucks under the blue frame above).  A blue layer is second
from the top, with orange thread around the outside, measuring 420
x 65 mm visible.  The third layer is white with gold brocade and
blue thread around the outside, measuring 428 x 67 mm visible. 
A green layer is fourth, with pale yellow thread around the outside,
measuring 436 x 72 mm visible, and the fifth layer beneath is orange,
with green thread around the outside, measuring 442 (top)/ 446 (bottom)
x 76 mm visible. They are not exact rectangles of material, the
lower edge of the orange layer forms a slightly wavy line, and in
parts it only just covers the whole of the window frame; its left
edge bulges slightly. </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
Uniquely in this volume, before the writing, after the triple yig
mgo, we find a flaming jewel motif, coloured gold, red and blue.
There are miniatures to the left, right, and centre, besides which
the areas for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular
pattern of gold lines. This is unlike other volumes which each have
a single such pattern as borders for the right and left miniatures,
but not for the central miniature. The pattern on the strips bordering the
left and right miniatures is made up of the hexagon and dot pattern
with 5-8 dots surrounding each central dot. The pattern on the strips
bordering the central miniature is made up of the diamond and swastika
pattern. (See "General Information on Volumes" for descriptions
of these patterns.) The strips bordering the miniatures at the sides
are roughly 10 mm wide, while the strips bordering the central miniature
are narrower, 7-8 mm wide. Moreover, in this volume there are further
horizontal strips as borders underneath the left and right (but
not central) miniatures. In each case, we find a strip of similar
dimensions to the vertical strips (8-10 mm wide), split into two
bands. Above, there is a narrow band, which has the same pattern
in both, a wavy line going along the strip, forming a series of
areas above and below in each of which there is a curved line pattern.
In the case of the lefthand miniature, the larger horizontal band below
has the same diamond and swastika pattern which we find as the side
borders for the central miniature; in the case of the righthand
miniature, the larger horizontal band below has the same hexagon
pattern which we find as the side borders for the left and right
miniatures. </font>
</p>     
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The larger miniature in the centre,
which breaks up the page, is within a rectangle measuring 65 x 70mm,
although the paintings of the consorts extend outside the frame
into the gold patterned strips. The lefthand miniature is within
a rectangle measuring 50 x 60mm (although the bottom extends very
slightly over the horizontal strip below), the righthand miniature's
rectangle is 49 x 60mm (although the bottom extends very slightly
over the horizontal strip below). The legends for the miniatures
are written below each, within the border of gold lines outside
the window. Each legend is within double ornamental brackets: </font>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Uniquely
in this first volume, the recto side of gnyis is not simply the
usual blue lacquer, but is designed similarly to 1b (without the
curtained window), and there are further miniatures. The folio is
a laminate of about 5 sheets. Thick crossed stitches attach the
folio together, two along the top, two along the bottom and one
to the left and right, although the stitch on the right has come
out and is only in evidence on the verso side. Where the stitch
has come away, it is possible to see that, of the inner plain paper
sheets, some are entirely plain, while some have red margins and
ruled lines. Again, we find mid-blue around the outside of the page,
with elaborate intertwining straight gold lines, with the same interlocking
key design in black lacquer, outlined in gold, against the mid-blue
background, as on 1b . The upper sheet has a rectangular window
drawn in the centre (not cut out as in 1b) for the text, 457mm x
72 (left)/ 75 (right) mm, outlined with a red paint line. Within
the frame is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 4 lines of gold writing. There are miniatures to the left and

line. The lefthand miniature is within a rectangle measuring 53
x 70mm; the righthand miniature's rectangle is 50 x 72mm. The legends
for the miniatures are written below each, within the border of
gold lines beneath the window. Each legend is within double ornamenal
brackets:  <font color="red">[first, to the left:]</font> {{<font color="red">[yig mgo

2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper. 2b - 6a have
double red lined rectangular boxes and margins; in the case of 2b
and 3a, with an inner double red lined rectangular box. 2b and 3a
have 4 lines each of black writing; 3b - 5b have 5 lines of slightly
smaller writing; 6a, has 6 lines of writing. The outlined boxes
measure as follows. 2b: outer box, 500 x 80 mm; inner box, 482 x
64 (left)/ 67 (right) mm; 3a: outer box, 487 x 80 (left)/ 84 (right)
mm; inner box, 469 x 64 (left)/ 68 (right) mm; 3b: 491 x 82 mm;
4a: 483 x 80 mm; 4b: 487 x 80 (left)/ 76 (right) mm; 5a: 483 x 80
mm; 5b: 482 x 79 mm; 6a: 486 x 80 mm. The boxes are not very exact
rectangles, and the ink sometimes makes thicker lines. 6b starts
the usual style of red margins down the side and 7 lines per side.

<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> There are two folios 58 (nga brgyad). The first of these
(given first in the microfilm), which has writing slightly larger
and thicker than the preceding and following folios, is a misplaced
folio. It gives a chapter reference as follows: (58a line 6-6) thugs
kyi rgyud dam pa las/ thugs rje 'byung ba'i tshul bstan pa'i le'u
ste gnyis pa'o// This corresponds to the second chapter of the "byang
chub kyi sems thugs kyi rgyud rin po che spungs pa'i rgyan", found in
gTing skyes Vol Ga (Kaneko 47) (and in Virginia's catalogue Vol
Pa: Tb.309). In a comparison of the folio against gTing skyes Ga:
120.6-123.1, which gives the end of ch.2 and beginning of ch.3,
the text corresponds exactly to what we find on our misplaced folio.
 It is highly likely that this text would be found in our Volume
Ga, but we are missing this volume. This folio might come from another
collection entirely, since it is clearly marked as part of Vol. Ka,
although it is possible that it is a folio from Volume Ga, mislabelled
as Ka.  We have a similar instance of misplaced folios labelled
as belonging to Volume La (la brgya gnyis and brgya bdun), which
in fact fit in Volume Wa.  It would be necessary to find our missing
Volume Ga to establish whether this has happened in this case.</font>

<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>  

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">On the final page, 294a, there is a black circular Bodleian
Library stamp to the lefthand side of the margin, dated 18.3.1909. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> 294a is the final
page. The text is within a red rectangular box, measuring 482 x
83 mm, with 6 ruled lines, of which 3 are used.  294b has seven
ruled lines and red margins, which are not used. There are, however,
a few very faint syllables scribbled sideways about three-quarters
of the way across the page, but these appear to have been on an
underneath layer of paper used for repairing a tear (see below),
and they do not seem to have any relevance for our subject matter. </font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">This final
folio is quite badly damaged. Besides a number of small holes over
the page (as on so many other folios in this volume), it has large
tears out of the edges, the bottom righthand corner is torn away,
and there are some tears and creases down the page. It seems that
the folio had been torn into two. There is a tear right down the
folio on the righthand side, but the two sides of the page have
been joined back together: a piece of paper has been stuck along
the tear line on the verso side of the folio. Repairs/reinforcements
of the folio are also evidenced by strips of paper stuck along both
sides of the upper and bottom edges. Despite the poor condition
of the folio, all the writing is clearly legible.</font>
