<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Dza</h2>
</center>
<br>


<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is written in blue pencil numbers.
 The first index leaf (see below) bears a rectangular IOL paper
sticker, white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped
decoration in each corner), with the red handwriting: "296 pages";
and in blue writing, "MISC. COLLN GYUT. 19"; and in large Tibetan
writing, "rgyud dza".  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Some sheets
are thinner than others (eg. 34, 194), although most are quite thick,
appearing to consist of two layers of paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets is 576 x 125mm.  There is some size variation (eg. 18 is
571mm in length), and some sheets are not cut very straight (especially,
many of the right- and left-hand edges are not entirely straight;
52 has a left hand edge 119mm and a right hand edge 125mm; the bottom
edges of 68 and 114 are rather wavy, and the bottom edges of 255
and 256 are ragged). </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes, many
of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways, some
of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do occur,
they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.   The lines are ruled
with faint (diluted?) reddish ink. The writing is not always exactly square
on the page  (eg. 192b). Sometimes the lines are not ruled very
straight: eg. the fourth line on 32a, and thus the writing, goes
up and down. The writing on the fourth line of 134b does not follow
the line and goes up and down across the page.   </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-4.  gNyis, gsum, and bzhi each have a triple yig mgo,
and the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  The regular
double yig mgo usually start on or to the right of the red vertical
margin delineators.  There are some slight differences in style,
with some larger or more elongated than others. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The writing in this
volume seems to be quite consistent in style although the lettering
seems to be generally slightly larger nearer the end of the volume;
the letters are mostly clear and distinct throughout. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are many
sheets with large areas of brown blotches, eg. 2b, 3a, 49b, 51a.
 Some sheets have small ink smudges, eg. 23a, 24a, 27b, 34a, 35a,
42a, 45a, 61a/b, 65a, 69a, 89a, 139a, 151a, 201a, 212a, 223b, 227a. However,
the clear writing is hardly ever obscured . </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing
in this volume is rarely obscured by tears and rips. Most sheets
are in a reasonable state with few holes or tears - there are occasional
small holes and tears, and most sheets are brownish in colour and in
some cases rather dirty. Some sheets have small tears out of a corner,
eg. 4, 58, 60, 91, 155. 80, 95, 197, 290 have a corner torn off.
Some have small holes outside the writing area, eg. 23, 52-4, 94,
103, 106-7, 284, 294. 48 has three small holes within the writing
area but at least two may have predated the writing, since the syllables
are broken up to avoid them. The same applies to the small hole
on 134. 49, 105, 132, 140, 181, 222 also have small holes within
the writing area. In the case of 104, holes within the writing area
do obscure some words, which can nonetheless be deciphered. There
are some edge tears, eg. 30, 57, 96, 150, 192, 233, 252, 281, 293
and some edge indentations eg. 34, 55, 98-9, 105, 116, 118-9, 121,
226, 284. There are some attempted repairs of edge tears, eg. 29a,
31a, 32a, 56b, 71b, 84b, 101a, 119a, 202a, 288 each have a small
piece of paper stuck on top of a tear; paper is stuck to each side
of the edge of 38, 226 and 289. The last two folios, 295 and 296,
have pieces torn from the edges, holes in the writing area, and
attempted repairs of edge tears. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The blue lacquered
front folio measures 565mm (above)/ 560mm (below) x 110mm (left)/
118mm (right).  The edges are slightly torn, as well as not being
very straight. The lacquer has come away in parts.  It is plain blue
in colour, with margins ruled in red on the recto side, making a
box  449 x 42 mm.  The index leaves are sewn to the right-hand side
of the folio, with 2 large leather red cross stitches, and white
thread running stitches.</font>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The first
folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 14 sheets, 570 x 125 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. The box made by the ruled
lines measures  450 x 63mm (left)/ 66mm (right), with the vertical
lines not at exact right angles to the horizontal lines. The blue
sheet is torn slightly at the edges and the blue lacquer is rubbed
off in parts. There are a few edge tears.  Thick crossed stitches
attach the folio together, two along the top, five along the bottom,
and one to the left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper sheet
has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  450 x 73mm, outlined
(around the frame) with a red paint line.  There is a small section
to the right of the upper window frame which is missing.  Also missing
is a large strip of the bottom window frame, running from the left
of the frame up to the second of the lower crossed stitches attaching
the folio together. </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window, with three layers sewn together.
Most of the upper part of the cover tucks under window frame above,
but where there is a small section of the upper window frame missing,
the top yellow layer and yellow running stiches attaching the cover
to the folio are visible in this gap. The yellow layer is at the
top, with gold thread around the outside, and it measures 427 x
86 mm to the top of the folio, 62 mm visible beneath the frame (the
upper part tucks under the blue frame above).  A blue layer is the
middle layer, with white thread around the outside, measuring 437
x 68 mm visible beneath frame.  The third and final layer beneath
is orange, with green thread around the outside, measuring 447 x
75 mm visible beneath the frame. They are not exact rectangles of
material, they go in very slightly to the bottom and the bottom
edge of the orange layer forms a slightly wavy line, and it does
not quite cover the whole of the window frame. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips, but unlike all the other
volumes, these strips lack any decoration, and are plain black.
This does not mean that less work went into the painting; on the
contrary, the miniatures in this volume are finely executed.  The
larger miniature in the centre, which breaks up the page, is bounded
to the left and right by a thin double vertical gold line, outlining
a rectangle, 81 x 70mm. The lefthand miniature is within a rectangle
50 x 69mm, the righthand miniature's rectangle is 50 x 70mm. The
legends for the left-hand and central miniatures are missing. We
can hazard the following possible reconstruction in line with other
volumes: </font>
</p> 
<font color="red">[<font color="red">first, to the left:</font>]</font> {{
<font color="red">[yig mgo x 1]</font>// rig 'dzin tshe dbang nor bu la na

<font color="brown">oyan</font>

side of the gold vertical strip transversing the text:</font>]</font> 
<font color="brown">mkha'gro</font>
 ye shes mtsho rgyal//}} <p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Then, we actually find
the legend for the right-hand miniature, as usual, within the gold
lines making the pattern on the window frame: </font>
</p> 

<font color="red">[<font color="red">third, to the right:</font>]</font> {{<font color="red">[yig

</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, within
a double gold rectangular box, the outer measuring 485 x 76 mm,
the inner, 468 x 65 mm.  The margins are ruled as usual, with the
collection, volume and folio identification to the left. The boxes
are not exact rectangles; the vertical lines are not at exact right
angles to the horizontal lines, coming down slightly to the left.
The folio is a laminate of about 8 layers, with thick cross stitches
visible on both sides, two to the top and bottom, one to the left
and right. Some of the inner sheets have red margins and lines ruled,
and two have some text on one side. The verso side is ordinary paper. </font>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 6a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins; in the case of
2b and 3a, with an inner double red lined rectangular box.  2b and
3a each have 4 lines of black writing; 3b - 5b, have 5 lines of
slightly smaller writing, and 6a, 6 lines of writing.  The boxes
are not very exact rectangles, and the ink sometimes is of variable
thickness. Sometimes, the lines overshoot the boxes or do not quite
join up at the corners. The writing lines are not exactly parallel
to the horizontal lines of the boxes: the lines on 2b, 5a and 6a
come up slightly at the right.  The boxes measure as follows. 2b
(outer): 488 x 80 mm; 3a (outer): 500 x 86mm (left)/ 89mm (right);
3b: 490 x 88mm (left)/ 82mm (right); 4a: 488 x 77 mm; 4b: 480 x
80 mm; 5a: 484 x 79 mm; 5b: 486 x 82 mm; 6a: 494 x 82 mm.    6b
starts the usual style of red margins down each side and 7 lines
per side.</font>

folio 296 has some damage to the edges, especially the bottom edge
which is torn away, but the folio has been reinforced with a strip
of thick paper stuck the whole way along the sheet on the verso side,
and a strip of paper stuck to the right-hand edge of the recto side.
Despite this, the box with the whole writing area is clearly legible. </font>
