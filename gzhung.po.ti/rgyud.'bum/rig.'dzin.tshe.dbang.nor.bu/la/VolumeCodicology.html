<h2>Codicological information on Volume  La</h2>
</center>
<br>


<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is written in blue pencil numbers.
 The first index leaf (see below) bears a rectangular IOL paper
sticker, white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped decoration
in each corner), with the red handwriting: "247 pages"; and in blue
writing, "MISC. COLLN. GYUT 26."; and in large Tibetan writing,
"rgyud la". </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Most sheets
in this volume are quite thick, apparently consisting of at least
two layers of paper, although some folios are thinner than others (eg.
201; 94 is thin despite consisting of two layers).  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets varies a little: most are 572-8 x 125 mm.  Some sheets are
not cut very straight. Especially, many of the left-hand edges go down
to the left or occasionally to the right, some of the right-hand
edges are similarly badly cut (eg. 84), and some of the other edges
are not straight, such as the wavy upper edge of 133.    </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes,
many of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways,
some of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do
occur, they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.   The lines are ruled with
faint (diluted?) reddish ink. The writing is not always exactly
square on the page (eg. 5b, where the writing goes up slightly to
the right).   </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-4.  gNyis, gsum and bzhi each have a triple yig mgo,
and the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  The regular
double yig mgo usually start on or to the right of the red vertical
margin delineators.  There are some slight differences in style,
with some larger or more elongated than others. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume seems to be quite consistent in style, with some size variation;
the letters are mostly clear and distinct.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing
in this volume is rarely obscured by tears and rips. Most sheets
are in a reasonable state with few holes or tears. The condition
of the paper is a little variable: the colour of the sheets varies
from off-white to brown, some folios are rather crinkled, and many
sheets are rather dirty or have dark streaks or spots (eg. 88 and
136a have brown blotches and spots on them). However, the clear
writing is hardly ever obscured . Some folios have small holes outside
the writing area, eg. 10, 11, 13, 14, 24, 28, 148, 181, 234, 244.
48 and 99 each have a small hole within the writing area which appears
to have predated the writing since there appears to be some attempt
to avoid them on 48a and 99b respectively. It is difficult to tell
whether a similar hole on 103 was also deliberately avoided. Other
folios, eg. 188, 222, 233, have a tiny hole in the writing area,
not affecting the writing. Some folios (eg. 9-11, 27-9, 31-4, 48,
56, 62, 67-9, 96, 98, 108-110, 112-117, 122, 134, 173, 192, 198,
203, 209-210, 218, 220, 223, 226, 235, 241, 243-246) have edge indentations.
18, 21, 49, 60, 108, 119, 128, 153, 202, 210, 218, 219 each have
an edge tear. 10, 48, 68, 83, 164 have a corner torn off. Some syllables
are obscured on 50b and 51a, where a small piece of the top layer
of 50b appears to have come off and stuck to 51a. There are similar
problems on 55b/56a and 203b/204a. There is some evidence of attempted
repairs, eg. a small piece of paper stuck over a torn edge: 67,
69, 80; or on one side of an edge: 166a, 243b. Final folio 248 is
in poor condition. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The blue lacquered
front folio has been damaged and repaired. The folio measures approximately
555 at its longest point x 115mm (left)/ 112mm (right). It has been
torn into two right down the sheet and repaired with thick thread
stitching attaching the two sides together. The sheet otherwise
is in poor condition, with tears in the edges, especially along
the left-hand side, much of which has been torn away, and some creasing.
 The lacquer has come away in parts. The recto side is plain blue
in colour, with margins ruled in red, making a box measuring approximately
448 x 39 mm. The verso is also plain blue, and the index leaves
are sewn to the right of the folio, with thick leather cross stitches,
and red thread stitches which attach the layers together, as well
as some black and some white thread stitching. </font>
</p>

<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of at least 16 sheets, 572 x 125
mm. </font>
</p> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but
with gold margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. Some of the lacquer has
been rubbed off, there are also some tears in the edges, and close
to the right-hand edge, the top sheet appears to have been torn
right the way down. However, both sides of the tear remain in place.
The box made by the ruled lines measures 425 x 67 mm, with the vertical
lines not at exact right angles to the horizontal lines, but coming
down slightly to the left.  Thick crossed stitches attach the folio
together, two along the top, five along the bottom, and one to the
left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper
sheet has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  450 x 73mm,
outlined (around the frame) with a red paint line.  There are three
tears in the upper window frame.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window, with three layers sewn together.
Where there are tears in the upper window frame, yellow running
stitches are visible beneath the frame, attaching the material layers
to the sheets below.  The yellow layer is at the top, with gold
thread around the outside, and it measures 430 x 86 mm to the top
of the folio, 68 mm to the left/ 61 mm to the right visible beneath
the frame.  A blue layer is the middle layer, with white thread
around the outside, measuring  432 x 71 visible beneath the frame
to the left and 65 mm visible to the right.  The third and final
layer beneath is orange, with green thread around the outside, measuring
440 x 75 mm visible beneath the frame to the left and 71 mm visible
to the right.  They are not exact rectangles of material, the bottom
edge of the orange layer forms a slightly wavy line, and it does
not quite cover the whole of the window frame, especially on the
right and left sides, where there are slight gaps between the curtain
and frame. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, the wave design (see "General Information
on Volumes"). The larger miniature in the centre, which breaks up the
page, is bounded to the left and right by a thin double vertical
gold line, outlining a rectangle, 80 x 69mm. The lefthand miniature
is within a rectangle 50 x 69mm, the vertical double gold lines
coming down very slightly to the left; the righthand miniature's
rectangle is 50 x 70mm. The legends for the miniatures are written
below each, within the border of gold lines outside the window.
Each legend is within double ornamenal brackets: </font>

68mm (right).  The margins are ruled as usual, with the collection,
volume and folio identification to the left. The boxes are not exact
rectangles; the vertical lines are not at exact right angles to
the horizontal lines, coming down slightly to the left. The folio is
a laminate of at least 6 thick layers, with thick cross stitches
visible on both sides, two to the top and bottom, one to the left
and right. The verso side is ordinary paper. </font>

of slightly smaller writing, and 5a, 6 lines of writing.  The boxes
are not very exact rectangles, and the ink sometimes is of variable
thickness. Sometimes, the lines overshoot the boxes or do not quite
join up at the corners.  The writing lines are not exactly parallel
to the horizontal lines of the boxes: on most pages, the lines come
up slightly at the right.  The boxes measure as follows. 2b (outer): 494

<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b>

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> 46 is missing; there is an IOL note dated 28/1/1949, noting
this.  The note appears once to have been stuck to 47, but has since
mostly torn off.  A comparison of ch. 7 of Rig &rsquo;dzin Tshe dbang
nor bu La 2 with mTshams brag&rsquo;s equivalent text shows that this missing

<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b>

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">We find two 102 brgya gnyis. The one marked in blue at the
side, 'Duplicate' (although it is not a duplicate) does not fit:
the writing is slightly different.  On examination, it is clearly
the missing folio 102 from Volume Wa (containing part of ch. 68
of Rig &rsquo;dzin Tshe dbang nor bu 
<b><a target="_new" href="http://ngb.csac.anthropology.ac.uk/csac/NGB/wa/1">Wa 1</a></b>

<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b>

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">We have a misplaced folio 107 brgya bdun (called, 'Duplicate'
in blue writing, although not a duplicate) which follows 107 brgya
bdun. This 107 Duplicate is in a different writing style from the main
text, and its content does not fit, while our other 107 follows
from 106 and leads on to 108.  On examination, it becomes clear
that this folio 107 Duplicate is correctly numbered 107, but incorrectly
labelled as from Volume La, when it is in fact from Volume Wa. 
We have a chapter ending given on 107b Duplicate line 3-4: /dpal

<font color="red">[

on the folio 107 which is missing in Volume Wa (see under Rig &rsquo;dzin
Tshe dbang nor bu 
<b><a target="_new" href="http://ngb.csac.anthropology.ac.uk/csac/NGB/wa/1">Wa 1</a></b>
).  A card note has been inserted into the ms here. Three people
seem to have contributed comments: &ldquo;[1] Not a duplicate, but f.
107 of vol. 'a (23) ? [2] 'a 107 in place [3] Not R! Vol. 22 Za
The work is called dpal zla-gsang nag-po'i rgyud. It is the last
text of vol 22. S.G. Karmay.&rdquo; Note that Samten Karmay&rsquo;s comment
correctly identifies the name of the text which is given in Volume
Za (Rig &rsquo;dzin Tshe dbang nor bu Za 22).  However, this text is another
version of the dpal zla gsang nag po&rsquo;i rgyud, and its ch. 72 (entitled,
&ldquo;srog gcod spu gri zla gsang gi le'u ste don gnyis pa'o&rdquo;) is similar
but not exactly the same as ch. 72 of the edition given in Wa.  However,
a comparison between ch. 71-73 of Za 22 and 
<b><a target="_new" href="http://ngb.csac.anthropology.ac.uk/csac/NGB/wa/1">Wa 1</a></b>
 is useful in that it shows beyond doubt that the text we have on
this misplaced folio 107 exactly corresponds to the text missing
in 
<b><a target="_new" href="http://ngb.csac.anthropology.ac.uk/csac/NGB/wa/1">Wa 1</a></b>
, after Wa folio 106 and before folio 107.  Similarly, a comparison
with the version in Za 22 also demonstrates that our earlier extra
folio 102 (also a missing folio in Wa) has the part of the text for
ch. 68 of 
<b><a target="_new" href="http://ngb.csac.anthropology.ac.uk/csac/NGB/wa/1">Wa 1</a></b>
 which is missing between Wa folios 101 and 103. </font>

been reinforced by pieces of paper on the back, but the lines no
longer run straight across the page, and some of the syllables in
the middle are slightly obscured. One of the pieces of paper used
for a repair has Chinese writing on it. Moreover, two of these repairs
are further covered with IOL note paper with red edges, perhaps
to act as further reinforcement. The edges of the folio are also
badly torn down and repaired with pieces of paper in several places.
Despite this, the writing is mostly legible. </font>

<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b>

<p>

on one side. This folio resembles the usual front folios to which
index leaves are attached; it has possibly come from one of the
other volumes, and been mistakenly placed here. In any case, there
are no attached index leaves, so it is not possible to be certain. </font>
