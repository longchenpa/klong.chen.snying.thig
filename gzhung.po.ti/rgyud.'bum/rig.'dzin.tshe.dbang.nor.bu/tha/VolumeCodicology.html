<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Tha</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is in black ink stamped numbers.
At the front of the volume, there is a long rectangle of coarse
red cloth, on which is stuck a rectangular IOL paper sticker, which
is white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped
decoration in each corner).  We find red handwriting, reading, '286
pages', blue writing, reading, 'MISC. COLN. GYUT 10', and in large
Tibetan writing, 'rgyud tha'.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  Some sheets are
thinner than others (eg. 84), although most are quite thick, appearing
to consist of two layers of paper.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets is 576 x 125mm.  There is some size variation (eg. 38 is
570mm and 210 is 568mm in length, while 39 is 578mm). </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">In this volume,
we do not find the tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways towards
the right on the left-hand side of the folio. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.  The lines are ruled with
faint (diluted?) reddish ink.  Some sheets are not cut very straight
(eg. the bottom edge of 32 goes down to the right), and the writing
is not always exactly square on the page (eg. the lines, especially
the final three lines, on 213b go down to the right). </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Apart
from 1-3 and 5, double yig mgo plus gter tsheg  
<font color="green">  (U0F14</font>)
  
 are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides up to 215,
and double yig mgo plus rnam bcad 
<font color="green">  (U0F7F</font>)
  
 are found from 216.  gNyis, gsum, and lnga each have a triple yig
mgo, and the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  The
regular double yig mgo usually start on or to the right of the red
vertical margin delineators.  There are some slight differences
in style, with some larger or more elongated than others.  In comparison
with other volumes, most of the yig mgo seem to be written with
more of a flourish, with a longer curved line beginning them on
the left.    Note that gter tsheg [ 
<font color="green">  (U0F14</font>)
  
] and rnam bcad [ 
<font color="green">  (U0F7F</font>)
  
] are used instead of the usual shad throughout this volume, the
former in the first part from folio 3 and the latter mostly in the
second part of the volume, inconsistently on some pages (interspersed
with 
<font color="green"> gter tsheg (U0F14</font>)
  
), eg. 169, and from 199b, and more consistently from 215b.  The
rnam bcad  
<font color="green">  (U0F7F</font>)
  
 in the second part of the volume are used inconsistently on some
pages (interspersed with 
<font color="green"> gter tsheg (U0F14</font>)
  
), eg. on 169, and from 199b, and more consistently from 215b.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Rubrication and bracketing</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Note that
in this volume, we have several examples of ornamental bracketing
of text titles in black and red ink from above: 99b, 112b, 122a,
146a, 182b, 205b, 261b. We also find a single example of rubrication
of a title (compare the more extensive rubrication in the first
part of Volume Pha): on 261b line 6, the first part of the first
title immediately following the bracketed title is given in red. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume seems to vary a little in style, with parts where the writing
is slightly larger or the ink thicker; the letters are mostly clear
and distinct. There are some distinctive features. For instance,
we often find reversed gi gu and small na ro where there are clusters
of writing above, and we also find a number of instances of ornamental
bracketing (see above).  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are some
ink smudges (eg. 2b) but the writing remains legible.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The writing
in this volume is rarely obscured by tears and rips. Most sheets
are in a reasonable state with few holes or tears - there are occasional
small holes and tears, or ink smudges, and most sheets are brownish
in colour and in some cases rather dirty. However, the clear writing
is hardly ever obscured. Some sheets have edge indentations, eg.
3, 6-7, 24-30, 42, 61-2, 64-6, 68-9, 72-80, 82-6, 88, 91, 98-9,
101-3, 106-7, 109-114, 120-2, 124-5, virtually all sheets 137-176,
180, 191, 194, 209, virtually all sheets 223-254, 277, 279; some
(eg. 33, 52, 108, 127, 144, 149-50, 208, 283-6) have larger pieces
torn out of the edges. Some sheets have one or more small holes
outside the writing area, eg. 7, 15-18, 42-3, 53, 72, 127, 142,
201-2, 215-8, 222, 245, 264, 280, 284-6. Some have one or more holes
within the writing area, eg. 49, 211-3, which may affect the writing,
but it is usually possible to decipher the affected word. A small
hole in the writing area of 49 appears to pre-date the writing;
a gap has been left for it. Some sheets have one or more edge tears,
eg. 3, 6, 71, 73, 86, 102, 108-9, 122, 124, 131, 148, 162, 174,
181, 194-6, 199, 211, 215-6, 219, 225-6, 232, 237, 250, 278, 282,
and some (eg. 272) a small part of a corner torn off. There are
some repairs of edge tears and holes; some sheets (eg. 87, 102,
113, 172) have a small piece of paper stuck over both sides of a
tear/hole, and some (eg. 92) have more than one repair. </font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> There is no blue lacquered
front folio in this volume.  At the front of the volume, there is
a long rectangle of coarse red cloth, on which is stuck a rectangular
IOL paper sticker with volume identification (see above). </font>

<h2>Index Leaves</h2>

<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are no index leaves in this volume.</font>
</p>
<hr>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 15 sheets, 571 x 124 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. The box made by the ruled
lines measures  430 x 71 mm, with the vertical lines not at exact
right angles to the horizontal lines, but coming down slightly to
the left. The blue sheet is torn slightly at the edges and the blue
lacquer is rubbed off in parts. Thick crossed stitches attach the
folio together, two along the top, five along the bottom, and one
to the left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper
sheet has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  449 x 73mm,
outlined (around the frame) with a red paint line.   There is a
tear in the upper window frame. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window, with three layers stitched
together, and stiched to folio above, with yellow running stitch
visible under the torn blue window frame. The yellow layer is at
the top, with gold thread around the outside, and it measures 431
x 60mm (left)/ 65mm (right) visible (the upper part tucks under
the blue frame above).  A blue layer is the middle layer, with white thread
around the outside, measuring 440 x 66mm (left)/ 70mm (right) visible.
 The third and final layer beneath is orange, with green thread
around the outside, measuring 450 x 72mm (left)/ 74mm (right) visible.
They are not exact rectangles of material, the orange left edge bulges
out a little towards the bottom, as does the blue right edge, and
the lower edge of the orange layer forms a slightly wavy line, and
it does not quite cover the whole of the window frame. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, the wavy line and spiral design (see
"General Information on Volumes"). The larger miniature in the centre,
which breaks up the page, is bounded to the left and right by a
thin double vertical gold line, outlining a rectangle, 80 (above)/
81 (below) x 70mm. The lefthand miniature is within a rectangle
50 x 69mm, the righthand miniature's rectangle is 50 x 70mm. The
legends for the miniatures are written below each, within the border
of gold lines outside the window. Each legend is within double ornamenal
brackets: </font>

<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The second folio, gnyis,
measures 575 x 125 mm. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, within
a double gold rectangular box, the outer measuring 490 x 82 mm,
the inner,  473 x 70 mm.  The margins are ruled as usual, with the
collection, volume and folio identification to the left. The boxes
are not exact rectangles; the vertical lines are not at exact right
angles to the horizontal lines, coming down slightly to the left.
The folio is a laminate of 5 thick layers, with thick cross stitches
visible on both sides, two to the top and bottom, one to the left
and right. Some of the inner sheets have red margins ruled; one
inner sheet appears to be a discarded version of Volume Tha, gsum.
There is a small hole outside the writing area which goes down through
several layers of paper.  The verso side is ordinary paper. </font>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 5a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins; in the case
of 2b and 3a, with an inner double red lined rectangular box.  2b
and 3a each have 4 lines of black writing; 3b - 4b, have 5 lines
of slightly smaller writing, and 5a, 6 lines of writing.  The boxes
are not very exact rectangles, and and the ink sometimes is of variable
thickness. Sometimes, the lines overshoot the boxes or do not quite
join up at the corners. The boxes measure as follows. 2b (outer):
480 x 82 mm; 3a (outer): 495 x 80mm (left)/ 78mm (right); 3b: 495
x 81mm (left)/ 79mm (right); 4a: 487 x 81 mm; 4b: 485 x 80mm (left)/
78mm (right); 5a: 481 x 81 mm.  5b starts the usual style of red
margins down each side and 7 lines per side.</font>
