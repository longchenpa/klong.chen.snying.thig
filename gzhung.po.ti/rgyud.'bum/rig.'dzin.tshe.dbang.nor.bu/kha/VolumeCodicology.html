<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Kha</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is in black ink stamped numbers.
At the front of the volume, there is a long rectangle of coarse
red cloth, on which is stuck a rectangular IOL paper sticker, which
is white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped
decoration in each corner).  We find red handwriting, reading, '318
pages', blue writing, reading, 'MISC COLL. GYUT 2', and in large
Tibetan writing, 'rgyud kha'.</font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Some sheets
are thinner than others (eg. 22 and 238 are thin and the writing
on each side is just visible on the other), although most are quite thick,
appearing to consist of two layers of paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets is 576 x 125mm.  There is some size variation. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes,
many of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways,
some of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do
occur, they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.    </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-3.  gNyis and gsum each have a triple yig mgo, and
the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  The regular double
yig mgo usually start on or to the right of the red vertical margin
delineators.  There are some slight differences in style, with some
larger or more elongated than others. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume seems to be of a fairly consistent style throughout, with
the letters mostly clear and distinct and the ink often quite thick.
Sometimes the ink appears through on the other side of the folio
(eg. dots of the ink from 142a are visible on 142b, and similarly
dots of ink from the other sides are visible on both sides of 153
and 154). The writing varies only very slightly in size. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Corrections and interventions</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
are two small holes in the writing area of 180; in the 3rd line
of 180a, we find almost one third of the line has been amended.
The original letters have been removed from the page, and replaced
with new smaller letters. The removal has made the paper thinner
and generated the holes, although the writing is clearly legible
on both sides of the folio. There is a similar amendment, with the
longer string of inserted syllables going over the end of and beginning
of line 3 and 4 respectively on 244b, but the sheet is thick and
there is no damage to the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>    
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are
occasional  ink smudges and many sheets have slightly discoloured
brownish patches. However, the clear writing is hardly ever obscured.
192a has a brown mark to the right, over a few syllables on each
of the first 4 lines, but the writing remains legible. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The writing
in this volume is rarely obscured by tears and rips. Most sheets
are in a reasonable state with few holes or tears - there are occasional
small holes and tears.  In a small area at the top of 11a, the surface
is uneven, seemingly due to a small piece of the top layer of paper
having come away, presumably before the sheet was written on, since
a gap is left over the uneven part of the sheet in the top line.
There is a tear from the top edge of 17, going into the writing
area, but the writing remains clear. 22 has two small holes near
the bottom, below the writing, 280 has a small hole above the writing area.
Some folios have small tears, eg. 32, 186, 238, 252, 259, and 308
each have a small tear in the bottom edge; 122 and 155 each have
two such tears and 193 a larger bottom edge tear; 107, 150 and 314
each have a tear at the right edge; 115, at the left edge, and 240
at the top edge. Occasional sheets have edge indentations - eg.
82, 194, and 211 on the right edge, 99, 102, 149, and 165 on the
bottom edge; 156 on the left edge; and some have a single small
hole outside the  writing area, eg 91, 92, 157, 300, and 305. 150
has a small hole within the writing area but it presumably predated
the writing, since gaps are left around the hole; 170, 256, 257,
and 276 have similar holes.</font>
</p>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are two small holes
in the writing area of 180, due to an amendment (see above).  191
and 296 each have a single small hole in the writing area, not however
obscuring any letters. 238 has two small holes, not affecting the
legibility of the writing. 278 has the bottom right corner torn
off and a piece torn out of the left edge, but the writing area
is unaffected; 296 also has a bottom right corner torn off.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The blue lacquered
front folio, measuring approximately 570 x 115 mm, has been torn
into two pieces, and sewn together again, with plain paper stuck
to both sides and three blue thread cross stitches. However, the
front of one side of the folio seems to have been attached to the
back, since part of the red box is on one side of the folio, and
the other part on the other side! The folio is also torn and frayed
at the edges. The lacquer has come away in parts. It is plain blue
in colour, with margins ruled in red, making a box 360mm one side
of the folio, together with 86 mm on the other side, x 53mm one
side, and 44 mm on the other side.  </font>

<h2>Index Leaves</h2>

<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are no index leaves in this volume.</font>
</p>
<hr>

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The blue lacquered
front folio has been torn into two pieces, and sewn together again,
such that the front of one side of the folio seems to have been
attached to the back!  See description of Cover folios. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 15 sheets, 569 x 125 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. The box made by the ruled
lines measures 435 x 68 mm, with the vertical lines not at exact
right angles to the horizontal lines, but coming down slightly to
the left. The blue sheet is torn slightly at the edges and the blue
lacquer is rubbed off in parts. Thick crossed stitches attach the
folio together, two along the top, five along the bottom, and one
to the left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>  <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper
sheet has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  450 x 72mm
right/74mm left, outlined (around the frame) with a red paint line.
 Part of the lower window frame to the right of the centre, measuring
about 98mm across, is missing.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a material cover fitted over the window, with three layers. The
yellow layer is at the top, with gold thread around the outside,
and it measures 428 x 61mm visible (the upper part tucks under the
blue frame above).  A blue layer is the middle layer, with white
thread around the outside, measuring  436 x 65mm visible to the
right, 67mm to the left.  The third and final layer beneath is orange, with
green thread around the outside, measuring 447mm x 70mm visible
to the right, 72mm to the left. They are not exact rectangles of
material, the lower edge of the orange layer forms a slightly wavy
line, and to the left and right, it does not quite reach to the
window frame. </font>
</p>
</p>
 

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, the diamond and swastika design (see
"General Information on Volumes"). The larger miniature in the centre, which
breaks up the page, is bounded to the left and right by a thin double
vertical gold line, outlining a rectangle, 80 x 68mm. The lefthand
miniature is within a rectangle 52 x 69mm, the righthand miniature's
rectangle is 50 x 71mm. The legends for the miniatures are written
below each, within the border of gold lines outside the window.
Each legend is within double ornamenal brackets: </font>
</p> 
<font color="red">[
<font color="red">first, to the left:</font>]</font> {{<font color="red">[yig mgo
x 1]</font> //rig 'dzin tshe dbang nor bu la na mo//}} <font color="red">[
<font color="red">second, to the left of centre. Much of this is smudged
out and barely readable but the remnants of the syllables appear
to suggest a reconstruction in line with other volumes:</font>]</font> {{//lha lcam

remaining syllables are torn off; almost certainly they would have
been: gnyis pa oyan  <font color="red">[<font color="red">Then they would
have continued to the right of centre, on the other side of the
gold vertical strip transversing the text, torn off but reconstructed
in accordance with other volumes:</font>  rje/ mkha'gro ye shes

<b>Cloth volume wrapping</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The whole text
is wrapped in a coarse rectangular piece of orange cloth with a
fringe along one side, and near to the fringed edge, there is a
small rectangle of printed black ink, with what appears to be Hindi
writing. </font>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, within
a gold rectangular box, 480mm (top)/483mm (bottom) x 78 mm.  The
margins are ruled as usual, with the collection, volume and folio
identification to the left.. The box is not an exact rectangle; the
vertical lines are not at exact right angles to the horizontal lines,
coming down slightly to the left. The folio is a laminate of about
8 pages, with thick cross stitches visible on both sides, two to
the top and bottom, one to the left and right. The verso side is
ordinary paper. </font>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 6a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins.  2b and 3a
each have 4 lines of black writing; 3b - 5b, have 5 lines of slightly
smaller writing, and 6a, 6 lines of writing.  The boxes are not
exact rectangles, and the lines within them are not always exactly
square, eg. 5b's lines go up slightly to the right. The boxes measure
as follows. 2b: 496 x 82 mm; 3a: 496 x 82mm; 3b: 492 x 82 (left)/80 (right)
mm; 4a: 478 x 80mm; 4b: 482 x 78 mm; 5a: 490 x 82 right/80 left
mm; 5b: 487 x 79 mm; 6a: 482 x 77. Some of the lines overshoot the
boxes. 6b starts the usual style of red margins down each side and
7 lines per side.</font>
