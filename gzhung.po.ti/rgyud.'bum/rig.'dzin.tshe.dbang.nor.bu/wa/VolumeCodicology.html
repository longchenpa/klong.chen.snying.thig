<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Wa</h2>
</center>
<br>


<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is written in blue pencil numbers.
At the front of the volume, there is a long unevenly cut rectangle
of flower patterned western style cloth, on which is stuck a rectangular
IOL paper sticker, which is white with red borders (as in other
volumes, with a heart-shaped decoration in each corner).  We find
red handwriting, reading, '297 pages', blue writing, reading, 'MISC.
COLN. GYUT 20', and in large Tibetan writing, 'rgyud wa'.   </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Some sheets
are thinner than others (eg. 69, 227), although most are quite thick,
appearing to consist of two layers of paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets is 576 x 125mm.  There is some size variation (eg. 12 is
571 mm in length). Many sheets in this volume are not cut very straight.
 For instance, the top edge of 28 is 570 mm, its bottom edge 565 mm,
its left edge 115 mm and its right edge 122mm.  49 and several sheets
from 164-172, from 180-191, and numerous folios in the remainder
of the volume, are similarly badly cut; the bottom edges of 143
and 149 are badly cut; the left-hand edges of 35, 45, 50, 55, and
58 come down to the right; the left-hand edges of 51, 53, 56, 110,
and 251-4 go down to the left, all the edges of 11 are crooked,
the bottom edge of 57 is wavy). </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes,
many of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways,
some of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do
occur, they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.   The lines are ruled with
faint (diluted?) reddish ink. The writing is not always exactly
square on the page (eg. the writing lines come up slightly to the
right on 169).   </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-4.  gNyis, gsum and bzhi each have a triple yig mgo,
and the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo.  The regular
double yig mgo usually start on or to the right of the red vertical
margin delineators.  There are some slight differences in style,
with some larger or more elongated than others. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume varies a little in style, size of letters and thickness of
ink; the letters are mostly rather small but clear and distinct. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are occasional
ink smudges (eg. 13a, 73a, 222a 'Duplicate').  Some folios have
dark blotches on them, eg. 198a, 206b, although the writing remains
clearly legible.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Despite the
poor general condition of the sheets, the writing in this volume
is rarely obscured by tears and rips. There are occasional small holes
and tears, and most sheets are brownish in colour or have brown
spots and in many cases they are dirty. However, the clear writing
is hardly ever obscured. 3, 67, 72, 76, 232 have edge tears. 4,
9, 10, 15, 17-22, 30-31, 34, 36-41, 43, 55, 57-61, 63-5, 79, 103,
105-9, 123-5, 127-130, 137, 146-149, 160, 162-171, 175-7, 179-184,
211-215, 218, 233-4, 238-241, 245-6, 248-252, 257-8, and 292-7 have
edge indentations. Some sheets have small holes outside the writing
area; eg. 10, 11, 14, 149, 183, 209 (marked in blue as 210), 235,
237-9, and 245. 132 has several small holes, mostly outside the
writing area. They may have predated the writing; a hole on line
1 of 132a appears to have been avoided when writing. There are a
number of tiny holes on 168, but the writing remains clearly legible.
265 and 274 both have small holes within the writing area, but no
syllables are unreadable. Some sheets have attempted repairs eg.
17, 116, 127, 148, 174, 210 (marked as 211 in blue western numerals),
219, 221, 258 each have a small piece of paper stuck over a tear
at one edge, 76 over a corner tear; 5, 24, 69, 88, 101, 118, 122,
128, 136, 209 (marked as 210 in blue western numerals), 212 (marked
as 'duplicate' in blue writing), 296, each have a piece of paper
stuck over an edge, covering both sides; 225a has a piece of paper
stuck just below the writing area. 19, 87, 161, 260 each have a
piece torn from a corner. 139, 178, 199, 258, 270 each have an edge
tear, 140 has an edge tear and corner crease; 296 has a crease across a
corner, making some of the letters rather difficult to read. 279
has a long edge tear, going into the writing area, but the writing
is still legible. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> There is no blue lacquered
front folio in this volume.  At the front of the volume, there is
a long rectangle of flower patterned western style cloth, on which
is stuck a rectangular IOL paper sticker (see above) with the volume identification. </font>
</p>

<h2>Index Leaves</h2>

<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are no index leaves in this volume.</font>
</p>
<hr>
 

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 16 sheets, 569 (top)/
571 (bottom) x 122 mm.  </font>
</p> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure
blue lacquer, but with gold margins ruled and the collection, volume,
and folio identifications given at the left border, in gold writing.
The box made by the ruled lines measures 442 x 71 mm, with the vertical
lines not at exact right angles to the horizontal lines, but coming
down slightly to the left. The blue sheet is torn slightly at the edges
and corners (the upper left corner has several layers folded over) and
there are a few tiny holes in the top layers of the sheets.  The
blue lacquer is rubbed off in parts. A strip of plain paper is stuck
to the upper edge, presumably as a repair.  Thick crossed stitches
attach the folio together, two along the top, five along the bottom,
and one to the left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper
sheet has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  450 x 74mm,
outlined (around the frame) with a red paint line.  In this volume,
there is some damage to the upper window frame: part of the blue
layer is torn away at the edge, a small section from the bottom
edge is torn off completely on the left and there is a small rectangle
of plain paper stuck as a repair to the centre of the frame. The
edge of the lower window frame also has small pieces of the upper
layer missing, as do the edges of the page, although the legends
are not obscured. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window, with three layers sewn together,
although the stitching to the left is coming away. The yellow layer
is at the top, with gold thread around the outside, and it measures 428
x 63 mm visible beneath the frame to the left and 65 mm visible
to the right (the upper part tucks under the blue frame above).
 A blue layer is the middle layer, with white thread around the
outside, measuring 440 x 69 mm visible beneath the frame to the left
and 71 mm visible to the right.  The third and final layer beneath
is orange, with green thread around the outside, measuring 449 x
75 mm visible beneath the frame. They are not exact rectangles of
material; the orange left edge bulges out and its bottom edge forms
a rather wavy line, and it does not quite cover the whole of the
window frame, especially at the lower left, where there is a slight
gap between the curtain and frame. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, the hexagon and dot design (see "General
Information on Volumes") with 5-7 dots surrounding each central
dot. The larger miniature in the centre, which breaks up the page,
is bounded to the left and right by a thin double vertical gold
line, outlining a rectangle, 81 x 69mm (left)/ 70mm (right). The lefthand
miniature is within a rectangle 50 x 69mm, the righthand miniature's
rectangle is 51 x 70mm. The legends for the miniatures are written
below each, within the border of gold lines outside the window. Except
for the righthand legend which appears to be incomplete (although
undamaged), each legend is within double ornamenal brackets:  </font>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, within two
double lined gold rectangular boxes, the outer measuring 473 x 80
mm, the inner, 458 x 70 mm.  The margins are ruled as usual, with
the collection, volume and folio identification to the left. The
boxes are not exact rectangles; the vertical lines are not at exact
right angles to the horizontal lines, coming down slightly to the
left. The folio is a laminate of 5 thick layers, with thick cross
stitches visible on both sides, two to the top and bottom, one to
the left and right. Some of the inner sheets have red margins and
lines ruled, and at least one side has some writing on it. The verso
side is ordinary paper. </font>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 5a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins; in the case
of 2b and 3a, with an inner double red lined rectangular box.  2b
and 3a each have 4 lines of black writing; 3b - 4b, have 5 lines
of slightly smaller writing, and 5a, 7 lines of writing.  The boxes
are not very exact rectangles, and the ink sometimes is of variable
thickness. Sometimes, the lines overshoot the boxes or do not quite
join up at the corners. Not all the writing lines are exactly parallel
to the horizontal lines of the boxes: eg. the lines on 4b come up
slightly at the right. The boxes measure as follows. 2b (outer):
473 x 80 mm; 3a (outer): 493 x 77 mm; 3b: 493 (top)/ 491 (bottom)
x 80 mm; 4a: 479 x 78mm (left)/ 80mm (right); 4b: 490 x 81mm (left)/
84mm (right); 5a: 500 x 82 mm. 5b starts the usual style of red
margins down side and 7 lines per side. </font>

<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b>

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Note that we have a misplaced sheet: an extra 209,
which looks rather distinct from the rest of the text, which does
not appear to follow on from 208, nor to follow on to the other
209 or 210. Furthermore, in a comparison of our text against gTing
skyes, the text on this folio is not included, but runs straight
from the text we have on the correctly placed 209b to 210a.  Another clue
that this folio is misplaced is that have gter tsheg 
  (U0F14)
  
 throughout this 209a - 209b, and we also have truncated Om. syllable
with gter shad (gter yig mgo a thung, 
  (U0F01)
  
, + ma, 
 anusva&rsquo;ra (U0F7E)
  
, above) in the left top corner, as in the folios in volume a&rsquo;h..
Furthermore, we have a chapter ending for what appears to be another
text, and does not seem to fit here. The chapter ending is as follows
(209a extra nyis brgya dgu line 4-4): zhi ba 'dus
pa rtsa ba'i rgyud las% byang chub sems mnyam pa nyid sdug bsngal
dang bral ba zhes bya ba'i le'u ste bzhi pa'o% The puzzle is where
the folio comes from: it is clearly marked as from Volume Wa. The
extra folio has caused some muddle in the western numbering. This
folio is followed by another (apparently correctly placed) nyis
brgya dgu, marked in blue pencil western numerals as 210, although
this is crossed through with ordinary pencil and though not visible
on the microfilm, it is replaced with 209. The subsequent folios
are then also numbered in blue pencil (which has not been corrected)
beginning with 211, so that the western numerals are from this point
one ahead of the Tibetan written numbers, until nyis brgya bcuis,
which is given as "212 duplicate", following nyis brgya bcuig, which
is given as 212. </font>
