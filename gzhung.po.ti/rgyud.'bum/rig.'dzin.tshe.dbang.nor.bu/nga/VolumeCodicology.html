<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Nga</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is in black ink stamped numbers.
 The first index leaf (see below) bears a rectangular IOL paper
sticker, white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped
decoration in each corner), with the red handwriting: "323 pages";
and in blue writing, "MISC. COL GYUT 4"; and in large Tibetan writing,
"rgyud nga".  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  Some of the sheets
of paper are thicker than others.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the standard non-illuminated
 folios is  around 577 x 125mm. There is some size variation.  Some
of the sheets of paper are not cut very straight and thus, are not
very exact rectangles. The top and bottom  edges of folio 302 are
both cut in rather wavy lines. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes, many
of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways, some
of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do occur,
they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.   The writing is not
always exactly square on the page (eg. 73 is 575mm top/578mm bottom
x 125mm, and the ruled lines are not exactly horizontal on the page,
sloping down slightly from left to right).    </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-3, and 5.  gNyis,  gsum and lnga each have a triple
yig mgo, and the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo. 
There are some slight differences in style in the regular double
yig mgo, with some larger or more elongated than others. </font>
</p>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, there is more frequent use of  
<font color="green"> (rin chen spungs shad) (U0F11</font>)
  
after 1st syllables than in other volumes, where 
<font color="green"> (nyis tsheg shad) (U0F10</font>)
  
 or 
<font color="green"> (tsheg shad) (U0F0F</font>)
  
 is preferred.   </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume seems to be of a fairly consistent style throughout, varying
slightly in size, rather smaller than many of the volumes, but generally
with quite thick ink strokes.  </font>
</p>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">We find a couple of
instances of colophons of named persons given in small writing,
as is usual for the first (cover) title of a text. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Corrections and interventions</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">We
find some evidence of corrections: the insertion of syllables beneath lines,
or the rubbing out of syllables (eg. 108a) and in some cases, the
writing in of corrections (eg. 74a, 132b), but it is uncertain whether
these were later or the work of the original scribe. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Marks and blemishes</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Some pages (eg.
6a, 81a) have areas of ink smudges, although this rarely makes the
letters illegible.</font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The writing
in this volume is rarely obscured by tears, smudges or washing out,
but there is much damage to the edges of many of the folios, especially
in the first half of the volume, with large pieces of paper, especially
corners, torn off. Folios 2-58 all have damage to upper right corners,
the earlier folios with large corners torn off (but not affecting
writing area), the later folios with the corners only slightly torn.
Folios 293-4 have a small part of the top right corner torn off.
Folios 46-86 and 90-131, 148-176, 231-252 all have badly damaged
upper left corners (folios 132-147, 228-230 are also damaged but
less severely). Folios 127 and 198 have the bottom right corner
torn off. Folio 3 has the bottom left corner torn off, and pieces
also torn out along its edges. Folio 41 has a section of the bottom
edge torn away. Folio 318 has repair work to two tears extending
right down the folio, near the right-hand-side, cutting the folio
into pieces. The torn sheet has been attached together again with
black stiches sewn across both tears, making four rectangles of stitching
above and below the writing area.  Some sheets have one or more
small holes outside the writing area (eg. 38, 96, 99, 107, 108,
112, 120-127, 159, 174, 176-7, 179-180, 188, 192, 195-6, 228-9,
233, 240, 242-3, 246-7, 249, 312, 321-3). 39 has two such holes,
and a piece of paper torn out of its right edge, as well as some
corner damage. Some sheets have edge indentations, not affecting
the writing area (eg 73, 91, 102, 116, 129, 175, 178, 197, 226,
242-4, 260-1, 271-280, 282, 295-6, 299-301, 308, 313-6), or small
tears (eg. 126, 195). Some sheets (eg. 59, 198, 236b and 237a) have
small areas of white spots, but again, writing is not affected. 160
has a small hole within the writing area, affecting syllables on
both sides of the sheet, but the words can still be made out. 204,
240, 264, 281 have small holes in the writing area, but the syllables
are unaffected, and 235 also has a tiny hole in the writing area,
seemingly where  a correction to the text has been made. The final
folios 321-3 are frayed around the edges, and 322 has its upper
right corner torn off, but the writing remains clear. </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The blue lacquered
front folio, measuring approximately 573 x 115 mm, has a tear down
the middle, extending about two-thirds of the way down, and it is
badly frayed at the edges, with the bottom left corner torn off.
  The lacquer has come away in parts. The recto side is plain blue
in colour, with margins ruled in red, making a box measuring 453
x 49mm. The verso is also plain blue, but in addition it has attached
to it beneath on the right an ordinary paper folio with unused red
boxes and margins both sides, attached to which also are the index
leaves. The index leaves are sewn with large string stitches visible
from both sides of the folio.</font>
</p>
</p>

<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The first
folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 14 sheets, 578 x 124 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border (rgyud nga gcig), in gold writing. The
box made by the ruled lines measures 433 x 67 mm, with the vertical
lines not at exact right angles to the horizontal lines, but coming
down slightly to the left. The blue sheet is torn at the edges and
creased and slightly torn down the middle. The upper right-hand
corner of the page is torn off. Thick crossed stitches attach the
folio together, two along the top, five along the bottom, and one
to the left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. The upper sheet
has a rectangular window cut out for the text,  448 x 76mm, outlined
(around the frame) with a red paint line.  There are some small
tears and rips to the window frame. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a material cover fitted over the window, with three layers. The
yellow layer is at the top, with gold thread around the outside,
and it measures 430 x 65mm visible (the upper part tucks under the
blue frame above).  A blue layer is the middle layer, with white
thread around the outside, measuring  436 x 66mm visible.  The third
and final layer beneath is orange, with green thread around the
outside, measuring 444mm x 75mm visible. They are not exact rectangles
of material, the orange layer bulges out and then goes in very slightly
at the left-hand side near the bottom, and goes in very slightly
at the bottom on the right-hand side. It does not quite cover the
whole of the window.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, the hexagon and dot design (see "General
Information on Volumes"), with 5-7 dots surrounding each central
dot. The larger miniature in the centre, which breaks up the page,
is bounded to the left and right by a thin double vertical gold
line, outlining a rectangle, 82 x 69mm. The lefthand miniature is
within a rectangle 51 x 69mm, the righthand miniature's rectangle
is 49 x 69mm. The legends for the miniatures are written below each,
within the border of gold lines outside the window. Each legend
is within double ornamenal brackets: </font>
