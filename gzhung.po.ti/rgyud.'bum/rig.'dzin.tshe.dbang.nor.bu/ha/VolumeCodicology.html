<h2>Codicological information on Volume  Ha</h2>
</center>
<br>


<p>
<b>Modern library pagination and markings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> In
this volume, the western numbering is written in blue pencil numbers.
 There is a piece of frayed floral cloth (Western style) at the
front of the volume, on which is stuck a rectangular IOL paper sticker, which
is white with red borders (as in other volumes, with a heart-shaped
decoration in each corner).  We find red handwriting, "289 pages";
blue writing, "MISC. COLL. GYUT 29", and in large Tibetan writing,
"rgyud ha".  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Paper composition</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">   Some sheets
are thinner than others (eg. 16, 82), although most are quite thick,
appearing to consist of two layers of paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Size of folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The size of the plain
sheets is 576 x 125mm.  There is some size variation, some sheets
are not cut very straight (especially, many of the left-hand edges
are not entirely straight). </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet numberings</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">As in other volumes,
many of the sheets have tiny Tibetan numerals written sideways,
some of which are missing or partially cut off, and where they do
occur, they do not seem to correspond to the page numbering in words.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Pagination</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Page details are given
in words written sideways in black ink, to the left of the writing
on each recto side.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Most sheets, as in
other volumes, have 7 lines of black ink writing, with double red
vertical lines to the sides of the writing.   The lines are ruled with
faint (diluted?) reddish ink. The writing is not always exactly
square on the page (eg. the writing on 214a goes down slightly to
the right).   </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>
			Ornaments, openings and punctuation
		</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Double
yig mgo are found in the upper left  corner of all recto sides,
apart from 1-3.  gNyis and gsum each have a triple yig mgo, and
the verso side of gcig also has a triple yig mgo, as does 88b (gya
brgya), following a title page.  The regular double yig mgo usually
start on or just to the right of the red vertical margin delineators.
 There are some slight differences in style, with some larger or
more elongated than others. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Handwriting</b>   
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The writing in this
volume seems to be a little variable, starting with smallish thin
writing and becoming larger with thicker ink, especially after about
the first 100 folios. From 246, the writing is particularly thick,
and appears to be written in a less experienced and less neat hand
than the earlier folios.</font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b>

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Note that there is a folio dgu cu and a dgu bcu. It is clear
that dgu bcu is a misplaced folio, in fact, the conflated folio,
dgu and bcu, from this volume (see note on folio 9/10).  </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Microfilm</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">dgu bcu (a) and dgu cu
(b) are not in the microfilm.</font>
</p>
</p>
    

<p>
<b>State of preservation</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">Some sheets
are frayed or torn or have rips at the edges (eg. 8, 11, 45, 52,
54, 93, 104, 105, 166, 186, 204, 229, 242) or a corner is torn off (86,
110, 158, 254) but the writing is rarely obscured by tears and rips.
There does not appear to be much insect damage to the sheets in
this volume. Occasional sheets (eg 72-3, 101, 103-7, 131, 134-8,
175-7, 266-7, 269-70, 276-9, 286-7) have a single indentation at
one edge, a single hole (42, 63-4, 93-4, 96, 99, 159, 190, 208,
227, 254, 281, 285), or more than one edge indentation (57-9, 61,
75, 125-6, 271-5, 288-9), or edge indentations and holes (60, 62,
111, 211, 268). Very occasional sheets (12-3) have more than one
hole. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Cover folios</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> There is no blue lacquered
front folio in this volume.  At the front of the volume, there is
a piece of frayed floral cloth, on which is stuck a rectangular IOL
paper sticker (see above) with the volume identification. </font>
</p>
</p>

<h2>Index Leaves</h2>

<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There are no index leaves in this volume.</font>
</p>
<hr>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: construction</b>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The
first folio, gcig, is a laminate of about 12 sheets, 577 x 123 mm. </font>
</p> 

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> The recto side is plain azure blue lacquer, but with gold
margins ruled and the collection, volume, and folio identifications
given at the left border, in gold writing. The box made by the ruled
lines measures 440mm x 65mm. There are some tears especially around
the edges, where parts of the blue layer are torn away, and several
small holes in the centre of the folio, taking off the blue layer
and some of the lower layers of paper.  Thick crossed stitches attach
the folio together, two along the top, five along the bottom, and
one to the left and the right of the folio.  </font>
</p>
</p>
  

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: frames</b>   <font color="red">[
<font color="red">TITLE PAGE</font>]</font>  
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">The verso side of
gcig (1b) is blue lacquer, with elaborate intertwining straight
gold lines around the outside of the page, outlining exactly the
same interlocking key design as we find in other volumes. One section
of this border has been torn off from the top of the folio and is
missing. The upper sheet has a rectangular window cut out for the
text, 446 x 71mm, outlined (around the frame) with a red paint line. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window curtain</b> 
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">There
is a silk cover fitted over the window, with three layers sewn together.
The yellow layer is at the top, with gold thread around the outside,
and it measures 431 x 62mm visible (the upper part tucks under the blue
frame above; the full top to bottom measurement visible where the
upper frame is torn is 86mm).  A blue layer is the middle layer,
with white thread around the outside, measuring 439 x 70mm visible.
 The third and final layer beneath is orange, with green thread
around the outside, measuring 443 x 73mm visible. They are not exact
rectangles of material, and they do not fit entirely over the window
at the left and right. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Decorated first folios: window layout</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Beneath
the cover is a double lined gold rectangle drawn on black lacquer,
with 3 lines of gold writing, split across two sides of the page.
 There are miniatures to the left and right, besides which the areas
for writing are bounded by vertical strips with a regular pattern
of gold lines, in this case, wave design (see "General Information
on Volumes"). The larger miniature in the centre, which breaks up
the page, is bounded to the left and right by a thin double vertical
gold line, outlining a rectangle, 81 x 69mm. The lefthand miniature
is within a rectangle 49 x 68mm, the righthand miniature's rectangle
is 49 x 69mm. The legends for the miniatures are written below each,
within the border of gold lines outside the window. Each legend
is within double ornamenal brackets: </font>

<p>
<b>Decorated second folios</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue">  The recto
side of gnyis is blue lacquer, with 4 lines of gold writing, within
a double gold rectangular box, the outer measuring 475 x 76mm (left)/
79mm (right), the inner, 460 x 65mm (left)/ 69mm (right).  The margins
are ruled as usual, with the collection, volume and folio identification
to the left. The boxes are not exact rectangles; the vertical lines
are not at exact right angles to the horizontal lines, coming down
slightly to the left. The folio is a laminate of 5 thick layers, with
thick cross stitches visible on both sides, two to the top and bottom,
one to the left and right.  The verso side is ordinary paper. </font>
</p>
</p>

<p>
<b>Page settings</b>
<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> As mentioned above,
2a has 4 lines of gold writing.  2b is ordinary paper.  2b - 6a
have double red lined rectangular boxes and margins; in the case
of 2b and 3a, with an inner double red lined rectangular box.  2b
and 3a each have 4 lines of black writing (although 3a has a long
insertion in smaller writing beneath the 4 lines); 3b - 5b, have
5 lines of slightly smaller writing, and 6a, 6 lines of writing.
 The boxes are not very exact rectangles, and the ink sometimes
is of variable thickness. Sometimes, the lines overshoot the boxes
or do not quite join up at the corners.  The boxes measure as follows.
2b (outer): 482 x 80 mm; 3a (outer): 498 x 80 mm; 3b: 499 x 82 mm;
4a: 490 x 81 mm; 4b: 490 x 82 mm; 5a: 490 x 80 mm; 5b: 487 x 78
mm; 6a: 500 x 81mm (left)/ 75mm (right).  6b starts the usual style
of red margins down each side and 7 lines per side.</font>

<b>Missing or misplaced folios and other numbering anomolies</b>

<p>
<b></b><font color="blue"> Folios 9 and 10 are missing. However, there is a
dgu cu and a dgu bcu in this volume.  It is clear that dgu bcu is
a misplaced folio, representing a conflated folio, dgu and bcu.
The folio clearly fits between folios 8 and 11, and a comparison
of the text found here on folio 8, conflated folio 9/10, and folio
11, against the mTshams brag edition (17-20), establishes that we
have indeed identified our missing folio.  </font>
