Though the oral precepts of the Nyingma were introduced from the time of the
imperial period, it was not until Minling Terchen Rigzin Gyurme Dorje (1646-1714)
and his younger brother Minling Lochen Dharmashri (1654-1718) wrote a series of
commentaries on these teachings that the kama (bka' ma) or collection of oral
transmissions were created. This indicated a separate category of Nyingma
canonical literature in contrast to the terma (gter ma) revelatory treasures.

In the 19th century, during the years 1840-1845, the scholar
Gyalse Zhenpen Thaye (1800-1855) composed a set of ritual texts in
association with the kama. Including the table of contents, this set
totaled 9 volumes (ka->ta) and 83 individual texts (sometimes delineated
as 88 Works), and printing blocks were carved at Dzogchen Monastery in Kham.
This was the first compilation of the Nyingma Kama Collections.

A few decades later at Peyul Monastery in 1875, Ggyaltrul
Pema Dongak Tenzin (1830-1892) added an additional 16 volumes, making
the total of the kama 25 volumes (ka->ra) including 266 individual texts.
The blocks for these were originally carved at Peyul Monastery and were
later practiced and developed as part of the curricula at all of the major
Nyingma monasteries in Kham, including Dzogchen, Katok, and Sechen.
This became known as the "phyogs bsgrigs thengs gnyis pa" or the second
compilation of kama.

Dudjom Rinpoche Jikdral Yeshe Dorje (1904-1988) later edited the existing
kama collection and added another 33 volumes (ka->si), totaling 58 volumes
or 567 individual texts. These were all handwritten manuscripts that were
printed in India and titled the Bka' ma rgyas pa (W19229). Zenkar Rinpoche
was then instrumental in publishing a set of 100 volumes that were
distributed to monasteries and libraries. This expanded edition was
the 3rd compilation of the kama.

In 1992, while Karma Delek was at Katok Monastery receiving the kama
transmissions, he noticed that they had additional kama works that
were not included in the Dudjom Rinpoche collection. A year later,
he visited Khenpo Munsel in Golok and discussed with him the additional
works that he had discovered at Katok. Khenpo Munsel suggested that the
kama undergo a recompilation, and though he did not have much money at
the time, he gave 1,000 yuan to Karma Delek to initiate the project.
He asked his students Katok Khenpo Jamyang and Nyarong Tsering Gyatso
to help. Under the auspices of this project, to actualize
Khenpo Munsel's request, Katok Khenpo Jamyang and Nyarong Tsering Gyatso
traveled to the various Nyingma monasteries throughout Kham, while Karma
Delek travelled through U-Tsang, Nepal, and India. Zenkar Rinpoche helped
in Europe and the United States, collecting rare kama manuscripts.
All of the editions of the kama that now exist were spurred by the
initial inspiration of Khenpo Munsel's advisement about the need to
recompile this important collection of Nyingma oral teachings.

In 1999, largely prepared by Katok Khenpo Jamyang, 100 copies of 120
volumes of kama texts were printed for the festive occasion of the
Tenth Day Ceremony (tshe'i bcu'i dus ston) at the reopening of
Katok Monastery. This collection is known as the Bka' ma shin
tu rgyas pa â€” the extremely extensive edition of the kama.
See this edition, Bka' ma shin tu rgyas pa (kaH thog) (W25983).

In addition to this one time limited edition printing of the 120 volumes,
there were printings of an additional 55 volumes that were distributed to
monasteries and added to the existing 58 volumes of the Dudjom Rinpoche edition.

In 2000, based on the Katok edition of the Bka' ma shin tu rgyas pa
that was printed a year earlier, Karma Delek advised a project to
remove what were determined to be  non-kama texts from the 120 volume edition,
creating a new edition in 110 volumes. See this edition, Bka' ma shin tu rgyas pa (W 21508).

Under advisement of Zenkar Rinpoche, Tsering Gyatso organized the computer
input of the entire kama. This was officially initiated as a government
project under the direction of the Sichuan Department of Minorities (Si
khron mi rigs don gcod khang) at the National Minority Rare Text Collection
and Restoration office (Dpe rnying dpe dkon 'tshol sdud khang). This
department spent 1 million and 3 hundred thousand yuan to re-compile,
edit, and publish the kama text collection in a total of 133 volumes
(ka->po) or 1,110 individual texts. A few additional texts were found
and added to this most recent collection. Though this is often referred
to as the second edition of the third compilation, it is in fact a fourth
compilation of the Nyingma Kama Collection. This project came to fruition
in 2009, and we have recently published a full outline on TBRC. See this
edition, Snga 'gyur bka' ma shin tu rgyas pa (W1PD100944).
